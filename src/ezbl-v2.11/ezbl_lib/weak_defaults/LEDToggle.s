;  Easy Bootloader Library for PIC24/dsPIC33/PIC32MM source file (ezbl_lib)
;
;  Summary:
;    Implements a default LEDToggle() API that attempts to run-time decode which
;    I/O pins (LATx register) to bit-field toggle. Up to 8 LATx bits are
;    inverted based on the bitmask input.

/**
 * Toggles the state of an array of LEDs using a logical XOR of the ledBitField
 * provided. I.e. only '1' bits toggle an LED state. '0' bits have no effect.
 *
 * To use this function, first call EZBL_DefineLEDMap() at global scope in one 
 * of your top-level project files to create the bit mapping between LED
 * bitfield positions and physical GPIO port pins.
 *
 * This is a wrapper API that internally calls:
 *      EZBL_MapToggle(ledBitField, &EZBL_LEDMap);
 *
 * @param ledBitField A bitmask representing an array of LEDs who's state
 *                    should be toggled. Each '1' bit in the bit field toggles
 *                    the corresponding LED on or off according to the existing
 *                    state in the LATx register (does not read from PORTx).
 *
 * @return Bitmask representing the LEDs that were previously on (as defined in
 *         the LATx register(s)) before XORing in the ledBitField value. Bits
 *         for LEDs that do not exist are returned as '0' values in the
 *         bitmask.
