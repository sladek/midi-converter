 * File:   LEDToggle.c

 *
 * Implements a default/weak LEDToggle() function that will be used if no such
 * function exists locally in the project. This implementation reads/writes to
 * the least significant 8 bits of LATA.

/**
 *  Toggles the state of an array of LEDs using a logical XOR of the ledBitField
 *  provided. I.e. only '1' bits toggle an LED state. '0' bits have no effect.
 *
 *  @param ledBitField A bitmask representing an array of LEDs who's state
 *                     should be toggled. Each '1' bit in the bit field toggles
 *                     the corresponding LED on or off according to the existing
 *                     state in the LATx register (does not read from PORTx).
 *
 *  @return Bitmask representing the LEDs that were previously on (as defined in
 *          the LATx register(s)) before XORing in the ledBitField value. Bits
 *          for LEDs that do not exist are returned as '0' values in the
 *          bitmask.
