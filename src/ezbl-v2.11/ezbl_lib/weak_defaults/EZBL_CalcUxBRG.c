/**
 * Computes the closest UxBRG value for the specified baud rate, assuming a 16x
 * clock sampling divider (BRGH == 0).
 *
 * The return value will be rounded to minimize total baud error magnitude, so
 * will be up to +/- 0.5 UxBRG steps faster or slower when a perfect match is
 * impossible for the given peripheral input clock.
 *
 * The UxBRG value computed is not written to any SFR.
 *
 * @param peripheralClock Input clock speed to the peripheral (typically system
 *                        clock speed in MIPS, ex: NOW_systemFrequency).
 *
 *                        On dsPIC33C devices, the UART_Reset() API configures
 *                        the UART peripheral to run at Fosc (2*Fcy), but
 *                        peripheralClock should still be specified as Fcy. The
 *                        UxBRG value computed will be computed against 2x this
 *                        peripheralClock parameter value.
 *
 * @param baud Baud rate to compute for, specified in bits per second. Ex:
 *             115200, 230400, 460800, 921600, etc.
 *
 *             If baud is a negative value, the return value will also be
 *             negative, but the magnitude will be correct. Take the 2's
 *             complement before assigning it to a UxBRG register.
 *
 * @return Closest UxBRG value needed to achieve the specified baud rate.
 *
 *         If baud is negative, the correct UxBRG value will be returned in 2's
 *         complemented form.
 *
 *         If baud is 0, 0 is returned without triggering a divide by zero
 *         error.
