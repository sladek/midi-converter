/**
 * Increments the upper bits of the internal NOW timer count based on roll over
 * of the 16-bits contained in the hardware timer. If applicable, this ISR also 
 * calls NOW_TaskDispatcher() to launch (at IPL0) NOW tasks that are due for 
 * execution.
 *
 * To ensure a pseudo-atomic update of bits [63:16] of the NOW count,
 * NOW_countPtr is used combined with two copies of the high bits. Rather than
 * incrementing and performing carry propagation on the "live" bits that could 
 * be in the process of being read by lower priority code, this ISR instead
 * increments the non-live buffer and commits the change by updating
 * NOW_countPtr. The NOW_32()/NOW_64() functions used for reading the current
 * count need only check that the NOW_countPtr value did not change (relative to
 * when first read) by the time all upper bits are read.
 *
 * This ISR is structured such that this ISR itself can be called from two or
 * more places in code simultaneously without corrupting the output result or
 * any internal state. For example, if the hardware interrupt calls this ISR
 * starting from the main() context, a higher priority ISR preempts execution
 * and then a polling call is made from the high priority ISR to this
 * _CCTxInterrupt() ISR, then two instances of this ISR will be simultaneously
 * executed without resulting in a double increment of the upper bits (or any
 * non-coherent increments to some of the component words).
 *
 * @return NOW_internalCountPing or NOW_internalCountPong is incremented by 1
 *         and NOW_countPtr is updated to point to the updated/now-live buffer.
 *
 *         Additionally, if this ISR is executed without any lower priority ISRs
 *         currently active (i.e. interrupt occurs starting from main() IPL0
 *         context), then the NOW_TaskDispatcher() internal function is called
 *         to launch any pending tasks. The NOW_TaskDispatcher() function
 *         executes at IPL0, so only a handful of instructions outside of the
 *         _TxInterrupt() ISR will block the CPU at the timer's configured IPL.
