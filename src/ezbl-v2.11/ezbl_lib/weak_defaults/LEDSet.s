/**
 * Turns on or off all LEDs according to the supplied bitfield.
 *
 * This function internally calls LEDToggle() twice, so LEDToggle() should be
 * defined to use this ezbl_lib API. If it is not defined, this function
 * accesses (all 16-bits that are implemented in) LATA instead.
 *
 * @param ledBitField Bitmask representing an array of LEDs that should be
 *                    turned on and off. Each '1' bit in the bit field turns
 *                    the corresponding LED on while each '0' turns the LED
 *                    off.
 *
 * @return Bitmask representing the LEDs that were previously on before setting
 *         the new value. Bits for LEDs that do not exist are returned as '0'
 *         values in the bitmask.
