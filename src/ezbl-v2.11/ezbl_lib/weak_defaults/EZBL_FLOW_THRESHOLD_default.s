;  Easy Bootloader Library for PIC24/dsPIC33/PIC32MM source file
;
;  Summary:
;    Supplies default symbol values for various ezbl_lib APIs that depend on
;    symbols that could appear in the Linker Script (via ezbl_tools.jar) or be
;    missing and not be manually defined (ex: calling EZBL_WriteROM() without
;    any EZBL infrastructure to do EEPROM emulation without a bootloader)
