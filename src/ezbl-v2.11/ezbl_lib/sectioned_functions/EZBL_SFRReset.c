/*******************************************************************************
  Easy Bootloader for PIC24 and dsPIC33 Library API Source File

  Summary:
    Writes a selectable group of system SFRs with reset default values to
    emulate device reset. Useful in hiding Bootloader execution state before
    launching an Application, allowing the Application to start in a predictable
    environment.

/**
 * Resets various system SFRs back to their hardware reset state. This is often
 * useful to passivate an EZBL bootloader to make it look as transparent as
 * possible to an Application project that desires full control of the system.
 *
 * @param itemsToReset 
 *      Collection of bit flag constants specifying what should be reset. A
 *      bit-wise OR'd combination of the following values are supported:
 *      <ul>
 *          <li>EZBL_RST_INT_EN - All Interrupt Enable (IECx) registers cleared
 *                                to 0x0000</li>
 *          <li>EZBL_RST_PORTIO - All TRISx/ANSELx registers are set to 0xFFFF
 *                                and all ODCx/CNENx/CNPUx/CNPDx registers
 *                                cleared to 0x0000 (unimplemented bits will
 *                                read-back as '0's)</li>
 *          <li>EZBL_RST_PPS - All Peripheral Pin Select RPORx/RPINRx registers
 *                             are cleared to 0x0000 to disconnect all inputs
 *                             and outputs from RPx/RPIx pins.</li>
 *          <li>EZBL_RST_PMD - All PMDx registers are set to 0xFFFF and then
 *                             cleared back to 0x000. This will turn off all
 *                             peripherals and set their SFRs back to hardware
 *                             reset states.</li>
 *          <li>EZBL_RST_INT - All Interrupt Enable (IECx) registers cleared to
 *                             0x0000, Interrupt Flag (IFSx) registers cleared
 *                             to 0x0000, and Interrupt Priority (IPCx)
 *                             registers rewritten with 0x4444 to restore IPL4
 *                             priorities.</li>
 *          <li>EZBL_RST_INT_FORWARDING - EZBL_ForwardBootloaderISR is written
 *                                        with 0xFFFFFFFF to relinquish all
 *                                        Interrupt processing to an Application
 *                                        instead of the Bootloader.</li>
 *      </ul>
