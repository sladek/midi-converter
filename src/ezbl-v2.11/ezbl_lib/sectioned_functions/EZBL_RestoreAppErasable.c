/**
 * Restores any Bootloader components (defined in ".text.EZBLEraseRestoreTable"
 * code section when Bootloader was linked) that might have been erased by
 * a Flash erase operation.
 * 
 * For example, on a device with device Config words located in flash at the end
 * of Application space but with Bootloader defined Config words present, an
 * erase of the last flash page must have Bootloader content reprogrammed before
 * any Application data can be written there to minimize bricking risk to the
 * Bootloader.
 *
 * It is safe to call this function multiple times if the restoreConfigBytes 
 * parameter = 0, even if all other bootloader components are already 
 * programmed to flash. The function first checks the destination address to see
 * if data is present before attempting to program it. On the other hand, if the 
 * device has Config bytes (Config words at >= address 0xF80000) and the 
 * restoreConfigBytes flag is non-zero, then this function should only be called 
 * once when needing to restore these Config bytes. Non-Flash based Config bytes
 * are always reprogrammed since they don't have a detectable erased state 
 * (like EEPROM, you just reprogram them without erasing first).
 * 
 * If a Reserved Bit in a flash Config word exists that requires a '0' to
 * be programmed to it, this bit is written to '0' by the 
 * __EZBL_TOOLS_COMPUTED_ERASE_RESTORE_TABLE element that applies to it
 * (assuming such an element was generated).
 * 
 * @param restoreConfigBytes On devices with "Non-volatile" Config bytes (not 
 *          flash based Config Words), a non-zero value for this flag specifies
 *          that any Bootloader defined Config bytes should be reprogrammed by
 *          this function. As noted above, these values are always programmed 
 *          for every call to EZBL_RestoreAppErasable() when this flag is set, 
 *          so minimize unneeded restore operations with this flag set to avoid
 *          wasting Config byte endurance.
 * 
 *          On devices with Flash based Config words ("Volatile Config Words"), 
 *          this flag is not applicable and ignored.
 * 
 * @return Any Flash address that the Bootloader requires and has stored in the
 *         .text.EZBLEraseRestoreTable section is reprogrammed, assuming the
 *         destination flash doesn't already have mismatched data stored
 *         there. Additionally, if the device has "Non-volatile" Config bytes
 *         and the restoreConfigBytes parameter is non-zero, the Bootloader's
 *         Config bytes will be programmed.
