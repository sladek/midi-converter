/**
 * DEPRECATED: Use EZBL_WriteROM() or EZBL_WriteROMEx() instead, which do
 * address checking against .text.EZBLNoProgramRanges table data instead.
 *
 * Identical to EZBL_WriteROM() except that the address range is checked
 * first for overlap with any bootloader addresses. Like EZBL_WriteROM(),
 * set EZBL_NVMKey = 0x03DF to permit the write. Any other value in
 * EZBL_NVMKey will cause all function behavior to execute, but without
 * actually writing anything to Flash or Config Words.
 *
 * If any overlap in Flash memory is detected, the overlapped region data is
 * converted to all '1's which is then skipped when Flash programming to
 * preserve all bootloader memory region contents.
 *
 * If any overlap in Non-volatile Config Word memory forced by the bootloader is
 * detected (addresses in 0xF8xxxx range), the overlapped region data is
 * converted to match the values coded in the bootloader so as not to allow the
 * bootloader specified values to change. This is done instead of all '1's
 * masking since all '1's is a valid Configuration Word value and can't be
 * assumed to already exist due to a prior erase operation. I.e. writing all
 * '1's are not skipped during programming.
 *
 * @param destProgAddr 24-bit unsigned long program memory address to start
 *                     writing to. The LSbit must always be '0'. When
 *                     programming flash memory with a native 48-bit flash word
 *                     size, the second LSbit must also be '0' to align to the
 *                     needed 0x4 boundary.
 *
 * @param *srcData Pointer to source data in RAM which should be copied to Flash
 *                 or Config Words. This data should be packed in 24-bit chunks
 *                 without phantom bytes. srcData must be writable. The data can
 *                 change while masking off overlapped bootloader regions. This
 *                 pointer does not have any alignment requirements.
 *
 * @param byteCount unsigned integer specifying how many bytes to sequentially
 *                  copy from *srcData to the Program Memory address range. This
 *                  value need not result in write termination on a perfect
 *                  flash word or Config Word address boundary. Automatic 0xFF
 *                  padding will be done to fill the word before programming.
 *
 * @return 24-bit unsigned long program memory address after the just programmed
 *         Flash Word or Config Word. *srcData RAM contents may also have
 *         changed according to the bootloader masking behavior.
