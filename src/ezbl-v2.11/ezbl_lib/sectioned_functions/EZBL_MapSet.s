/**
 * Write's '1' values from an integer bitmask into a mapped array of SFR<bit>
 * destinations, leaving any SFR<bit> targets corresponding to '0' bitmask
 * values unchanged.
 *
 * This function internally calls EZBL_MapInv() twice - first with 0x0000 as
 * the toggle value to read the existing state, then computes the needed toggle
 * values to set all '1' bits specified by the setBits bitfield.
 *
 * @param setBits Bitmasked bits that should be written as '1' to the mapping
 *                array, leaving mapping array bits corresponding to '0'
 *                bitfield bits unchanged.
 *
 * @param mappingArray Pointer to a (unsigned int) array. Index 0 must contain
 *                     a count of how many bit mappings follow in the array.
 *
 *                     Index 1 up to 16 shall encode SFR addresses and bit
 *                     positions to map to. Bits <15:12> encode the bit position
 *                     while bits <11:0> encode the SFR target address that the
 *                     bit applies to.
 *
 *                     Index 1 corresponds to bit 0 (LSbit) of the setBits,
 *                     index 2, is bit 1, etc.
 *
 * @param sfrAddrOffset Signed integer to add to each mappingArray SFR address.
 *                      Use this field to access related SFRs for the bitmap at
 *                      a known address offset while storing only one mapping
 *                      array for the hardware.
 *
 *                      For example, if the mappingArray was created against
 *                      LATx registers, and the TRISx register needs to be
 *                      read/toggled, specify sfrAddrOffset as:
 *                          (unsigned int)&TRISA - (unsigned int)&LATA
 *                      Note that TRISA comes before LATA on most device memory
 *                      maps, so the value computed will actually be a negative
 *                      number.
 *
 *                      Ensure the integral (unsigned int) cast is maintained
 *                      when referencing SFR pointers. Subtracting two pointers
 *                      directly yields a scaled quantity relative to the size
 *                      of the pointed to objects, which is not the address
 *                      offset.
 *
 * @return Bitmasked values read from the mapped SFR<bit> registers before
 *         writing '1's according to setBits.
