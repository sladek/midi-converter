/**
 * Inverts (toggles) the state of an array of mapped SFR<bit> destinations using
 * a logical XOR of the invertMask provided. I.e. only '1' bits toggle a mapped
 * SFR state. '0' bits have no effect on the corresponding SFR<bit> value.
 *
 * @param invertMask A bitmask representing an array of ordered bits who's state
 *                   should be toggled. Each '1' bit in the bit field toggles
 *                   the corresponding bit in the arbitrary SFR map. Unmapped
 *                   high order bits are ignored.
 *
 *                   Specify a invertMask of 0x0 to read the bit map without
 *                   writing/altering existing state.
 *
 * @param mappingArray Pointer to a (unsigned int) array. Index 0 must contain
 *                     a count of how many bit mappings follow in the array.
 *
 *                     Index 1 up to 16 shall encode SFR addresses and bit
 *                     positions to map to. Bits <15:12> encode the bit position
 *                     while bits <11:0> encode the SFR target address that the
 *                     bit applies to.
 *
 *                     Index 1 corresponds to bit 0 (LSbit) of the invertMask,
 *                     index 2, is bit 1, etc.
 *
 * @param sfrAddrOffset Signed integer to add to each mappingArray SFR address.
 *                      Use this field to access related SFRs for the bitmap at
 *                      a known address offset while storing only one mapping
 *                      array for the hardware.
 *
 *                      For example, if the mappingArray was created against
 *                      LATx registers, and the TRISx register needs to be
 *                      read/toggled, specify sfrAddrOffset as:
 *                          (unsigned int)&TRISA - (unsigned int)&LATA
 *                      Note that TRISA comes before LATA on most device memory
 *                      maps, so the value computed will actually be a negative
 *                      number.
 *
 *                      Ensure the integral (unsigned int) cast is maintained
 *                      when referencing SFR pointers. Subtracting two pointers
 *                      directly yields a scaled quantity relative to the size
 *                      of the pointed to objects, which is not the address
 *                      offset.
 *
 * @return Bitmask representing the mapped SFR bit values read before issuing
 *         any toggle write backs. Higher order bits that are not specified in
 *         the mapping array are returned as '0'.
