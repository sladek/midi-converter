/**
 * void EZBL_EraseInactivePartition(void);
 *
 * Starts erasing the entire inactive partition and then returns without waiting
 * for completion. NVMCON<WREN> remains set once the erase is done.
 *
 * Unlike most NVM functions, you do not have to set EZBL_NVMKey to any
 * particular value to allow the erase. You don't have to set it externally since
 * erasing the inactive partition won't normally brick your device. You'll still
 * have what you're currently running, so less pairanoia is waranted. Traditional
 * single-boot applications shouldn't call this function, so the linker will be
 * able to remove this code and not store the NVM unlock sequence so close to the
 * NVM unlock operation.
 *
 * Upon function return, EZBL_NVMKey will be cleared to 0x0000.
 *
 * To check if the erase is done, check NVMCON<WR>. Zero means the erase is done.
 *
 * If this function is called while a prior NVM Flash erase or write operation is
 * already in progress, the function blocks until the prior operation completes.
 * The erase operation is then started before returning.
