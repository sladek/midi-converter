  Easy Bootloader for PIC24 and dsPIC33 Library API Source File

  Summary:
    Implements the EZBL_ModifyROM() high level wrapper function which allows
    arbitrary unaligned, byte sized write operations with word and multi-page
    straddling to flash as if it were EEPROM or (really slow) RAM. Does direct
    write when possible or read-erase-modify-write automatically when required.

/**
 * Writes an array of data bytes to flash, preserving all data around the array
 * like a byte writable EEPROM or RAM memory. If required, sequential page
 * read-modify-erase-write operations are performed.
 *
 * To restrict writing/erase-rewriting to FlashHoles and Application space, set
 * <b>EZBL_NVMKey = 0x03DF;</b> prior to calling this function. To force writing
 * to any flash address, including Bootloader reserved ranges, set
 * EZBL_NVMKey = 0xDEAD;
 *
 * To preserve flash endurance, save execution time, and avoid potential data
 * loss on device reset, the destination Flash range is first compared with the
 * input data and the function returns immediately if the destination range
 * already exactly matches the input data.
 *
 * Likewise, if the flash range is blank (contains all 0xFFFFFF_FFFFFF flash
 * double words in the required write addresses), then the data is written
 * directly into position, skipping any page erase steps.
 *
 * If the destination range cannot be written due to existing mismatched data, a
 * full Read-Modify-Erase-Write sequence is performed on a page-by-page basis.
 * This entails allocating a buffer on the stack to contain a full flash erase
 * page worth of data, which is typically 1536 or 3072 bytes long, depending on
 * device (set by EZBL_ADDRESSES_PER_SECTOR linker symbol).
 *
 * Execution time may be quite long and if there is any risk of running out of
 * RAM, the caller should disable interrupts or take other precautions to ensure
 * the required stack RAM space is available.
 *
 * @param destPgmAddr 24-bit flash program space destination address. This
 *                    address must be an even, instruction word aligned, but can
 *                    straddle a native flash double word boundary on devices
 *                    that have ECC or program in 48-bit flash double word
 *                    sized chunks.
 *
 *                    To minimize flash endurance loss and execution time, it is
 *                    best if any object written is allocated to a double word
 *                    aligned address (i.e. multiple of 0x4 addresses). This
 *                    ensures no two objects will share a flash double word and
 *                    require extra erase/write penalties when writing the
 *                    objects via sequential EZBL_ModifyROM() calls.
 *
 * @param srcData Data space pointer to an array of bytes to write. If this
 *                parameter is null, no erase or write operation takes place.
 *
 * @param byteLen Number of bytes to write to flash. 0 is allowed, as are values
 *                less than the native minimum flash programming word size. In
 *                such cases, all existing data in the shared bytes within the
 *                programming word are preserved unchanged.
 *
 * @return Flash contains new data in the specified address range.
 *
 *         EZBL_NVMKey is reset to 0x0000, even if the early data compare test
 *         resulted in skipping of all Flash Erase/Write operations, byteLen is
 *         zero, or srcData is null.
