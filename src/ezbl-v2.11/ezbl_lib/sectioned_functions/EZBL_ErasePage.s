/**
 * void EZBL_ErasePage(unsigned long addressOnPage);
 *
 * Erases the page containing the specified address. Be very careful if calling
 * this function as the function will erase any legal page, including ones
 * inside your bootloader and also possibly including the same page that this
 * function itself is stored on.
 *
 * EZBL_NVMKey must have been externally set to 0x03DF or this function will
 * do nothing. Immediately upon use or return, EZBL_NVMKey will be set to
 * 0x0000.
 *
 * Do not call this function on PIC24FxxKxxx, or dsPIC30F devices. They have 
 * very different NVMCON bit encodings and are not supported at this time.
 *
 * NOTE: This function can take upwards of 45ms on some device families and 
 * target pages to complete. At frequencies appreciably slower than the maximum 
 * device frequency, even longer may be required. Therefore, you may need to 
 * issue a ClrWdt() call before calling this function, assuming the Watchdog 
 * timer is enabled. This also means that you should not configure a watchdog 
 * timeout of less than ~64ms, even when you pre-clear the timeout. This 
 * function does NOT internally clear the watchdog for you as it is packaged as 
 * a library routine where not everyone would desire such behavior.
 * 
 * @param addressOnPage 24-bit (unsigned long) specifying an address on the page
 *                      to be erased. Anywhere on the page will work as the
 *                      hardware will mask off the lower bits within the page.
 * 
 * @return Page erase operation will have started if EZBL_NVMKey was properly 
 *         set and no hardware Write Protect or other hardware features prevent 
 *         it. This function will not block the CPU if the hardware supports a 
 *         non-blocking page erase of the given address. You therefore should 
 *         call EZBL_WaitForNVMOpComplete() before attempting to modify any 
 *         NVMCON/NVMADR/NVMSRCADR/etc. state, including issuing any Table Write 
 *         (tblwth, tblwtl) instructions in your code. All EZBL NVM erase/write 
 *         operations include an internal check at their start that does the 
 *         equivalent of EZBL_WaitForNVMOpComplete(), including this 
 *         EZBL_ErasePage() function. Therefore, it is safe to call EZBL 
 *         implemented NVM functions without doing an explicit call to 
 *         EZBL_WaitForNVMOpComplete() beforehand.
