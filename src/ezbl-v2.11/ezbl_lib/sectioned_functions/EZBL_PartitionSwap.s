/**
 * void __attribute__((noreturn)) EZBL_PartitionSwap(void);
 *
 * Disables all interrupts by clearing all IECx registers, swaps to the 
 * presently inactive partition, and branches to the 0x000000 reset vector. 
 *
 * CORCON<IPL3>, SR<7:0> are all cleared atomically during the branch, resulting
 * in the CPU starting execution on the new partition in IPL0 (main() context) 
 * with the SR<RA> Repeat Active status bit cleared, so it is possible to call 
 * this function from within an ISR if needed to synchronize the swap to occur
 * just after some critical ISR code is done executing.
 *    
 * Interrupts are NOT restored in this function. The needed IECx bits need to be 
 * restored by the new partition's Application since we can't have any 
 * interrupts occurring while doing the partition swap unlock and bootswap, nor 
 * would it be safe to trigger an ISR while the new Application is busy 
 * executing initialization code needed for any ISRs that have changed.
 * 
 * To detect if execution is occurring in the new Application due to a genuine 
 * reset or due to a partition swap event, check the NVMCON<SFTSWP> status bit. 
 * It is zero on real reset and one if a partition swap has taken place.
 *
 * XC16 v1.30+ supports a callback function before executing the CRT 
 * initializer to allow you to control if variable initializer code should 
 * execute. This callback should be declared as int _crt_start_mode(void); with 
 * the return value of 0 meaning to execute all initializer code as normal and 1 
 * meaning to skip normal initialization for Live Update style partition swaps. 
 * The later case skips most variable initialization and branches to main() 
 * sooner.
 *
 * A suggested implementation of this callback is:
 *     int __attribute__((optimize(1))) _crt_start_mode(void)
 *     {
 *         return _SFTSWP;
 *     }
 *
 * XC16 v1.30+ also supports a new 'priority(n)' function and variable 
 * attribute, where n is an integer from 1 to 65535 and allows code fragments + 
 * variables to execute in advance of ordinary CRT variable initalization 
 * completion and also when _crt_start_mode() returns 1.
 *
 * The CRT initializes the stack pointer, SPLIM, DSRPAG, initializes any 
 * variables attributed with 'priority(1)' and then calls any void functions 
 * with 'priority(1)' also assigned as an attribute. 'priority(2)' variables are 
 * then initialized followed by 'priority(2)' functions and so on until no more 
 * priority tagged variables or functions are left, whereupon:
 *   if(_crt_start_mode() == 1)
 *      - user_init() functions are called, if any
 *      - main() is executed
 *   else   // when _crt_start_mode() == 0 or _crt_start_mode() is undefined
 *      - unattributed (ordinary) variables are initialized
 *      - uart_init() functions are called, if any
 *      - main() is executed
 *    
 * Using the priority attributes allows you to selectively reenable any 
 * time-critical tasks, such as specific Interrupts, in a controlled order so as 
 * to avoid any unnecessary execution delay during a partition swap event as the 
 * bulk of non-special variables gets initialized or zeroed.
 *
 * See the XC16 documentation for more information on the _crt_start_mode() and 
 * and priority(n) features.
 *     
 * NOTE: The FICD<BTSWP> Config word bit must be turned ON (cleared to '0') or 
 * else this function will execute as described, but without actually swapping 
 * partitions. Use #pragma config BTSWP = ON or EZBL_SET_CONF(_FICD, _BTSWP_ON) 
 * to appropriately configure this.
 * 
 * @return This function never returns. Execution branches through the reset 
 *         vector, resulting in all normal SFRs retaining state, but the stack 
 *         is reinitialized and RAM variables may (or may not) also be 
 *         reinitialized.
 *
 *         This function's prototype has the __attribute__((noreturn)) option 
 *         applied so the compiler can optimize away subsequent code (like a 
 *         ulnk and return instruction) as dead code.
