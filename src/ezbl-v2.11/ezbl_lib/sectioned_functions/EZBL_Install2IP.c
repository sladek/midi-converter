  Easy Bootloader Library API Source File

  Summary:
    Installs a .bl2 image file to the Inactive Partition of a Dual Partition
    device from an EZBL_FIFO based remote communications interface (ex: UART or
    I2C).

  Description:
    Erases the Inactive Partition, then sets up for flow control (if applicable),
    reads a .bl2 file from the communications medium, programs the file
    contents exclusively to Inactive Partition addresses (0x400000+), and 
    verifies correct Flash read-back contents/valid .bl2 file structure/
    valid CRC32.

/**
 * Reads a .bl2 file from the communications medium, checks that the offering
 * has a matching BOOTID_HASH, optionally checks that the APPID_VER field is
 * acceptable, erases the Inactive Partition, programs and read-back verifies
 * the .bl2 data records on the Inactive Partition, verifies overall file and 
 * communications integrity, and optionally programs FBTSEQ on the Inactive 
 * Partition indicating the new Application is valid and available for 
 * execution.
 *
 * This function is non-blocking and will return, even if an active bootload
 * operation is underway. To ensure bootload operations are completely handled,
 * this function should be called periodically anytime bootloader functionality
 * is desired.
 *
 * @param *s Pointer to caller allocated EZBL_INSTALL_CTX structure that must
 *           remain within scope anytime a bootload session occurs. Before
 *           calling EZBL_Install2IP() for the first time, set the following
 *           fields:
 *              s.state = SM_SYNC_INIT;
 *              s.timeout = (application defined NOW timeout value);
 *           For the timeout, specify the timeout in some combination of
 *           NOW_sec and/or NOW_ms, ex: s.timeout = NOW_sec*1u; for a one second
 *           communications idle timeout. Higher latency communications mediums,
 *           such as wireless links, will likely require more than 1 second.
 *
 *           On subsequent calls to EZBL_Install2IP(), pass the *s parameter
 *           back to the function with unchanged structure elements.
 *
 * @param EZBL_ADDRESSES_PER_SECTOR project symbol. This symbol must be defined 
 *        to match the hardware's native Flash Page Erase size, expressed in 
 *        flash addresses. Every 0x2 flash addresses is one 24-bit instruction 
 *        word, or 3 bytes of .bl2 record data. 0x4 flash addresses represents 
 *        one 48-bit flash double word, or 6 bytes of .bl2 record data.
 *          
 *        Most hardware requires 0x400 or 0x800 for this definition (i.e. 1536 
 *        bytes per page or 3072 bytes per page), with the needed value chosen 
 *        from the device data sheet. If this symbol is not set, the default 
 *        value of 0x400 addresses is used, which may or may not be correct for 
 *        your hardware target.
 *
 *        To assign this parameter, within a project source file, write:
 *              EZBL_SetSYM(EZBL_ADDRESSES_PER_SECTOR, 0x400);
 *        or,
 *              EZBL_SetSYM(EZBL_ADDRESSES_PER_SECTOR, 0x800);
 *        This should be placed at global/file level scope with the ezbl.h
 *        header already #include'd.
 *
 * @param BOOTID_HASH0, BOOTID_HASH1, BOOTID_HASH2, BOOTID_HASH3 project
 *        symbols. These are generated as a SHA-256 hash (truncated to 16-bytes)
 *        of the concatenated BOOTID_VENDOR, BOOTID_MODEL, BOOTID_NAME and
 *        BOOTID_OTHER strings defined in your EZBL makefile
 *        (i.e.: 'ezbl_dual_partition.mk', which is included in 'Makefile').
 *
 * @param APPID_VER_MAJOR, APPID_VER_MINOR, APPID_VER_BUILD project symbols
 *        defined in the EZBL makefile (i.e.: 'ezbl_dual_partition.mk', which is
 *        included in 'Makefile').
 * 
 * @param EZBL_AUTO_PROG_FBTSEQ optional project symbol to enable automatic 
 *        reprogramming of the Inactive Partition's FBTSEQ to be one less than 
 *        the presently Active Partition's FBTSEQ, enabling the new firmware to 
 *        go live on next reset or BOOTSWP.
 *
 *        To use this feature, within a project source file, write:
 *              EZBL_KeepSYM(EZBL_AUTO_PROG_FBTSEQ);
 *        This should be placed at global/file level scope.
 *
 *        FBTSEQ is programmed only if the entire programming sequence completes
 *        successfully, is verified to not be corrupted in transit, and reads
 *        back from flash as expected. In other cases, FBTSEQ is left either
 *        unprogrammed or programmed with the value contained in the original
 *        .hex file (.bl2 file).
 *
 *        When using this feature, do not create .bl2 files with the FBTSEQ
 *        Config word defined in it. If defined, it will be programmed as normal
 *        data and then require the EZBL_AUTO_PROG_FBTSEQ function to erase and
 *        reprogram the entire last page on the inactive partition - needlessly
 *        wasting flash endurance.
 * 
 * @param EZBL_NO_APP_DOWNGRADE optional project symbol. Set to 1 using
 *        EZBL_SetSYM() if you wish to trigger pre-erase/programming abort when
 *        the offered .bl2 image file contains
 *        APPID_VER_MAJOR.APPID_VER_MINOR.APPID_VER_BUILD version meta data that
 *        indicates the firmware is less than the presently executing
 *        application version (as defined by EZBL_appIDVer.appIDVer64).
 *
 * @param EZBL_FLOW_THRESHOLD optional project symbol. Provides loose control
 *        over flow control advertisements, as a byte count. Anytime the
 *        EZBL_COM_RX fifo contains >= EZBL_FLOW_THRESHOLD bytes worth of
 *        freespace available, a flow control message is generated, so smaller
 *        values for EZBL_FLOW_THRESHOLD cause more flow control advertisements
 *        to be generated while larger values can reduce overhead (at the
 *        possible expense of communications "burstiness").
 *
 *        If unspecified, the default value for EZBL_FLOW_THRESHOLD is 32 bytes.
 *
 *        To set this value, use the EZBL_SetSYM() macro in a project level
 *        source file.
 *
 * @param *EZBL_COM_TX Global pointer to a communications transmit FIFO for flow
 *        control and status messages. As an example, to use the default UART
 *        implementation, set:
 *          EZBL_COM_TX = &UART_TxFifo;
 *        To use an I2C slave medium, set:
 *          EZBL_COM_TX = &I2C_TxFifo;
 *
 *        By default, this parameter can be ignored as the associated
 *        communications RX ISR(s) contains a BOOTLOADER_WAKE_KEY definition,
 *        which causes the ISR to automatically set both EZBL_COM_TX and
 *        EZBL_COM_RX at the correct time based on an incoming data
 *        synchronization match of at least 8 bytes.
 *
 * @param *EZBL_COM_RX Global pointer to a communications receive FIFO to read
 *        the .bl2 firmware image from. As an example, to use the default UART
 *        implementation, set:
 *          EZBL_COM_RX = &UART_RxFifo;
 *        To use an I2C slave medium, set:
 *          EZBL_COM_RX = &I2C_RxFifo;
 *
 *        By default, this parameter can be ignored as the associated
 *        communications RX ISR(s) contains a BOOTLOADER_WAKE_KEY definition,
 *        which causes the ISR to automatically set both EZBL_COM_TX and
 *        EZBL_COM_RX at the correct time based on an incoming data
 *        synchronization match of at least 8 bytes. After this initial 8 byte
 *        key match, this function internally requires a BOOT_ID match, ensuring
 *        at least 16 more bytes are valid EZBL communications data.
 *
 *        Upon termination of the bootload operation (due to idle timeout,
 *        bootload failure, offered version mismatch, successful reprogramming,
 *        or any other cause), EZBL_COM_RX is set to 0 (null) to place this
 *        EZBL_Install2IP() function into a dormant/passive state (requires
 *        new ISR BOOTLOADER_WAKE_KEY match to wake up).
 *
 * @return <ul>
 *              <li>0 - normal operation. When in the passive state, this is the
 *                      immediate function response.</li>
 *              <li>1 - bootload-end event detected. A bootload-end event does
 *                      not necessarily indicate new firmware is available or
 *                      was attempted to be uploaded as COM RX idle timeouts are
 *                      also reported.</li>
 *         <ul>
 *
 *         When the return value is 1, read the s->bootCode parameter to
 *         determine the bootload-end cause.
 *
 *         For s->bootCode:
 *         Generally zero or greater is good, while negative values indicate a
 *         failure. Anything erased/programmed prior to a failure is left as it
 *         was upon failure detection (will automatically be cleaned up on next
 *         bootload attempt).
 *
 *         Specific return code meanings are:
 *         <ul>
 *          <li>EZBL_ERROR_SUCCESS (1): Operation completed successfully. The
 *              Inactive Partition is ready for execution.</li>
 *          <li>EZBL_ERROR_SUCCESS_VER_GAP (2): Operation completed successfully, 
 *              but the programmed image did not have an 
 *              APPID_VER_MAJOR.APPID_VER_MINOR field that was +1 (minor code) 
 *              from the existing application. Execution of the new code should 
 *              proceed by resetting rather than a Live Update bootswap.</li>
 *          <li>EZBL_ERROR_COM_READ_TIMEOUT (-20): Bootloader signaled 
 *              communications timeout attempting to read firmware image.</li>
 *          <li>EZBL_ERROR_IMAGE_MALFORMED (-21): Bootloader rejected firmware
 *              as malformed or of unsupported type. Possible communications
 *              error.</li>
 *          <li>EZBL_ERROR_BOOTID_HASH_MISMATCH (-22): Bootloader rejected
 *              firmware as incompatible (with this Bootloader project).</li>
 *          </li>EZBL_ERROR_APPID_VER_MISMATCH (-23): Bootloader rejected
 *              firmware as out of the required programming order.
 *
 *              This error is only generated when the EZBL_NO_APP_DOWNGRADE
 *              symbol is non-zero and the received
 *              APPID_VER_MAJOR.APPID_VER_MINOR.APPID_VER_BUILD information in
 *              the file is less than the presently executing Application ID
 *              version.</li>
 *          <li>EZBL_ERROR_HARD_VERIFY_ERROR (-24): Bootloader read-back
 *              verification failure.</li>
 *          <li>EZBL_ERROR_SOFT_VERIFY_ERROR (-25): Bootloader read-back
 *              verification mismatch in reserved address range.</li>
 *          <li>EZBL_ERROR_IMAGE_CRC (-26): Bootloader computed CRC mismatch
 *              with CRC contained in firmware image. Probable communications
 *              error.</li>
 *          <li>No return: Unhandled exception or unknown. (Image file may have
 *              records targeting unimplemented memory, causing an Address Error
 *              Trap upon verification, or electrical operating parameters are
 *              incorrect.) Ensure the image file was compiled specifically
 *              for this device and bootloader.</li>
 *         </ul>
