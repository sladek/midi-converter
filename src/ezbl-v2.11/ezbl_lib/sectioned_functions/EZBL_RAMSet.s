/**
 * void EZBL_RAMSet(void *dest, int value, unsigned int length);
 * void * EZBL_RAMSetEx(void *dest, int value, unsigned int length);
 *
 * Sets RAM efficiently, just like memset() but without dependence on a C
 * library that could go in application space or get optimized to inline code.
 * On the dsPIC30, PIC24F, PIC24H and dsPIC33F device families, 'length' is
 * limited to 14-bits + 1, or in other words, must be in the set of: {0..16,384}.
 *
 * @param *dest RAM pointer to write the repeating byte value to. Address can be 
 *              byte aligned. This pointer cannot be NULL (0x0000) except when 
 *              <i>length</i> is 0.
 * @param value 8-bit character to write to *dest. Upper bits are ignored.
 * @param length Number of bytes to write. This value must be <= 16384 on 
 *               dsPIC30, PIC24F, PIC24H, or dsPIC33F families. 0 is allowed, 
 *               resulting in no operation.
 * @return dest pointer, incremented by length bytes
