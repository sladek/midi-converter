/**
 * Measures an unknown-frequency clock source against another known-frequency 
 * reference clock source and computes the unknown frequency.
 * 
 * @param targetClockType
 *        <p>0x0 = 16-bit Timer/CCP/Counter in an SFR or RAM 
 *                 location. *refClock will be dereferenced as a 
 *                 volatile unsigned short to get "tick" 
 *                 values. In the case of a RAM location, an 
 *                 external ISR of higher priority than the present 
 *                 CPU IPL must write the new values into the given 
 *                 address as this function does not return until 
 *                 the DCO measurements are complete.
 *        <p>0x1 = 32-bit Timer/CCP/Counter in an SFR or RAM. 
 *                 *refClock will be dereferenced as a 
 *                 volatile unsigned long to get "tick" values.
 *        <p>0x2 = 16-bit "tick" via function pointer return.
 *                 *refClock must point to an executable function 
 *                 that takes no parameters and will return an 
 *                 incrementing 16-bit integer type (unsigned int, 
 *                 signed int, unsigned short, unsigned short int, 
 *                 signed short, etc.). Generally, it is possible 
 *                 to use this value even for 32-bit return valued 
 *                 functions, but in such a case, the upper 16-bits 
 *                 of information will always be discarded.
 *        <p>0x3 = 32-bit "tick" via function pointer return.
 *                 *refClock must point to an executable function 
 *                 that takes no parameters and will return an 
 *                 incrementing 16-bit integer type (unsigned int, 
 *                 signed int, unsigned short, unsigned short int, 
 *                 signed short, etc.).
 * 
 * @param targetClock       Pointer to the specified clock resource. See 
 *                          targetClockType parameter definition for exact 
 *                          meaning of this pointer.
 * 
 * @param refClockType      Same as targetClockType, but for the known-frequency 
 *                          reference clock.
 * 
 * @param refClock          Same as targetClock, but for the known-frequency 
 *                          reference clock.
 * 
 * @param refClockFrequency Frequency of the known-frequency refClock, in Hz.
 * 
 * @param desiredPPMPrecision   
 *                          Desired precision in measuring the target clock
 *                          frequency, in units of PPM (Parts Per Million). 
 *                          1000 PPM is equivalent to +/-0.1% clock error 
 *                          (1000/1000000 * 100%). 
 * 
 *                          Higher precision takes longer to measure, 
 *                          potentially with a Gaussian tail, meaning a LOT 
 *                          longer. 
 *                          
 *                          NOTE: if either the reference, and to a lesser 
 *                          extent, target clock frequency is unstable and 
 *                          drifts faster than the desired precision can be 
 *                          achieved, this function could block forever. To 
 *                          avoid this, specify a timeout.
 * 
 * @param milliTimeout      Maximum number of milliseconds allowed to try and 
 *                          achieve the desiredPPMPrecision criteria. To disable 
 *                          the timeout, specify 0.
 * 
 * @return  Present frequency of the targetClock, in cycles-per-second (Hz). If an 
 *          unrecognized parameter is given, 0xFFFFFFFF is returned.
