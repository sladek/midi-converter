/**
 * Atomically returns the least significant 32 bits of the current NOW counter
 * value (for NOW_32() calls) or the full 64-bits of the NOW counter (for
 * NOW_64() calls).
 *
 * This function is safe to be called from any IPL or ISRs with the return value
 * still being valid (i.e. reentrancy is allowed). When called from a higher
 * priority ISR or trap handler which blocks the _TxInterrupt() ISR from
 * executing, this function will automatically revert to a polling mode where
 * the _TxInterrupt() will be called as needed to ensure proper 16-bit carry
 * propgataion into bits 16 to 63. This ensures that all calls to
 * NOW_32()/NOW_64() will always be chronologically monotonic. I.e. this
 * function should never return a count that represents an earlier time than any
 * previous calls to NOW_32()/NOW_64() made within the last 2^32 counts (or 2^64
 * counts for NOW_64())
 *
 * Execution time is a fixed 21 or 27 cycles best (and normal) case, including
 * the call and return branches, depending on device. However, if you are very
 * unlucky and the lower 16-bits rolls over during the read (less than 0.01%
 * chance if no interrupt occurs), execution time will grow for a bounded, but
 * non-deterministic time.
 *
 * Both NOW_64() and NOW_32() are implemented as the same function with the C
 * compiler ignoring the upper 32-bits when NOW_32() is called instead of
 * NOW_64().
 *
 * @return 64 or 32-bit NOW counter value, where 1 NOW count is normally equal
 *         to 1 instruction cycle. Use the NOW_second, NOW_millisecond,
 *         NOW_microsecond variable contents, or the NOW_Diff_to_ms() and
 *         NOW_Diff_to_us() functions in order to make physical sense of how
 *         long a NOW count is at run time.
 *
 *         NOTE: the NOW_32() function overflows on the timescale of ~minute
 *         Ex: at 70MIPS, the longest interval you could correctly measure is
 *         61.356 seconds. Use the NOW_64() function if longer durations are
 *         being measured.
