/**
 * Schedules a task for execution at a earlier/later time than presently
 * scheduled.
 *
 * When the task is executed, the repeat interval will be added to the time at
 * execution to compute when the task will be run again (assuming the task
 * repeats). Therefore, this function will pull-in/push-out the whole train of
 * subsequent executions without affecting the repeat period for anything but
 * the present cycle.
 *
 * @param task A pointer to a staticaly or globally allocated NOW_TASK
 *             structure to modify.
 *
 * @param timeFromNow Number of now counts into the future when the task should
 *                    be executed next. Use NOW_second, NOW_millisecond, and
 *                    NOW_microsecond to choose this.
 *
 * @return Number of now counts pulled in (pushed out) from the original task's
 *         scheduled execution time. Time pulled in is represented as a positive
 *         number while negative numbers represent a pushed out time.
