/**
 * void EZBL_XORCopy(void *dest, void *source1, void * source2, unsigned int length);
 * void * EZBL_XORCopy(void *dest, void *source1, void * source2, unsigned int length);
 *
 * Bitwise XORs one array with a second array, storing the result in a third 
 * array. I.e. dest[i] = source1[i] ^ source2[i]; // for(i = 0; i < length; i++)
 *
 * @param dest Pointer to write the XORed bytes. The destination can match 
 *             source1 or source2 (or both if you want to just write zeros to 
 *             memory relatively inefficiently). Partial overlap is allowed, 
 *             keeping in mind that source1 will be read, source2 will be read, 
 *             the values XORed and finally written to dest. One byte is 
 *             processed at a time in sequentially ascending address order.
 * @param source1 Pointer to the first XOR operand
 * @param source2 Pointer to the second XOR operand
 * @param length Number of bytes to read from or write to each respective array.
 * @return dest pointer, incremented by length bytes
