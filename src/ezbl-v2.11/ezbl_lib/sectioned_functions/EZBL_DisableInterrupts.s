/**
 * unsigned int EZBL_DisableInterrupts(void);
 *
 * Disables all interrupts, including IPL7 ones by setting the current CPU 
 * execution level to IPL8 (IPL8 is allocated to the lowest priority Generic 
 * Soft Error Trap).
 *
 * The return value should be saved and subsequently passed to 
 * EZBL_RestoreInterrupts() to restore the original CPU IPL and interrupt 
 * processing.
 *
 * This function differs from traditional methods of raising the CPU to IPL7 or
 * setting the INTCON2<GIE> bit to disable Interrupts because:
 *  - PIC24F/dsPIC33F/PIC24H devices don't have a GIE bit
 *  - Newer devices, like the dsPIC33EP64GS506 family, include W-REG array 
 *    shadow sets which can be automatically invoked by setting the IPL to the 
 *    preconfigured shadow context's activation level.
 * As IPL7 is a useful place to assign a shadow register context set and since
 * universal portability is desired, this function triggers a higher IPL8 
 * state that cannot have a shadow register set assigned to it. Execution will 
 * continue using the same context registers as were selected during the 
 * EZBL_DisableInterrupts() call.
 *    
 * As IPL8 is allocated as the Generic Soft Trap, any DO stack overflows, 
 * Illegal opcodes executed, or other mupltiplexed traps implemented in INTCON3 
 * will be queued but supressed after EZBL_DisableInterrupts() returns. When 
 * EZBL_RestoreInterrupts() is called, any accumulated true Generic Soft Trap 
 * events will trigger vectoring to the Generic Soft Trap interrupt handler.
 *
 * All other traps will continue to vector normally while interrupts are 
 * disabled. 
 *
 * This function executes in 13 cycles (dsPIC33E/PIC24E/dsPIC33C devices) or
 * 8 cycles (dsPIC30F/dsPIC33F/PIC24H/PIC24F devices), including the call and 
 * return.
 *
 * @return Prior SR state (with IPL information) to be used by 
 *         EZBL_RestoreInterrupts(). 
 *         
 *         This function only uses w0. When calling from assembly, it is not 
 *         necessary to preserve the w1-w7 registers.
