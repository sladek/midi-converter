/**
 * Tests if all bytes on a given Flash Page are erased. Returns 1 if the entire
 * Page has '1's on it, or 0 otherwise. No special address checking or
 * conditions are exempted.
 *
 * Execution time is about 18 + 9,728 cycles/0x400 sized Flash page on
 * dsPIC33E/PIC24E/dsPIC33D/dsPIC33C Flash, or about 11 + 5,632 cycles/0x400
 * sized Flash page on PIC24F/PIC24H/dsPIC33F/dsPIC33C PRAM devices. These
 * assumes the page is blank. Non-blank pages will return earlier.
 *
 * NOTE: This function requires the _EZBL_ADDRESSES_PER_SECTOR link time symbol
 * to be set to the number of program addresses that represents one Flash Erase
 * Page on your hardware. On most devices, this is either 0x400 or 0x800 and
 * will be automatically set by ezbl_tools.jar in the project's .gld linker
 * script or by the Bootloader project you link to. However, if you are not
 * using ezbl_tools.jar or an existing EZBL Bootloader, you can manually define
 * this value by using the EZBL_SetSYM() macro in one of your C source files:
 *      <p><code>EZBL_SetSYM(EZBL_ADDRESSES_PER_SECTOR, 0x400);</code></p>
 *
 * 0x400 program addresses is equivalent to 1536 bytes, or 512 24-bit
 * instruction words. Be sure and check the size in the device data sheet when
 * manually assigning this value.
 *
 * @param programAddress Flash program memory address to check. This address
 *                       does not have to be page aligned. All bytes on the page
 *                       will still be checked if an unaligned (or odd) address
 *                       is provided.
 *
 * @return  <ul>
 *              <li>1 - Page is erased and contains all 0xFF bytes</li>
 *              <li>0 - Page contains one or more '0' bits on it</li>
 *          </ul>
