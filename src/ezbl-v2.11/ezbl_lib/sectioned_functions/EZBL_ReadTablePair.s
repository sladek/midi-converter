/**
 * Reads two consecutive instructions words (24-bits each + 8-bits of filler on
 * 16-bit devices, 64-bits total) from program space and increments a read
 * address pointer by 0x4 (for 16-bit devices) or 0x8 (32-bit devices).
 *
 * TBLPAG on 16-bit devices is internally saved, used and restored before return.
 *
 * Function blocks if an outstanding NVMCON<WR> operation is underway (16-bit
 * dual partition devices).
 *
 * The read address range can straddle 64K TBLPAG boundaries.
 *
 * @param *pgmReadAddr Pointer to a RAM variable containing the address which
 *                     will be consecutively read from flash memory. Note: this
 *                     is effectively a RAM pointer to a flash pointer and the
 *                     function will return with *pgmReadAddr (the RAM pointer)
 *                     incremented.
 *
 * @return  2 x 32-bits of aligned data read from flash. The high bytes of both
 *          32-bit instruction words on 16-bit platforms are returned as 0x00.
 *
 *          *pgmReadAddr is incremented by 0x4 or 0x8, as appropriate for the
 *          device architecture.
