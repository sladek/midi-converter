;    Assembly language optimized memcpy() replacement function that can perform
;    better at run time by selectively performing word moves instead of byte
;    mode only moves.

/**
 * void EZBL_RAMCopy(void *dest, const void *source, unsigned int length);
 * void * EZBL_RAMCopyEx(void *dest, const void *source, unsigned int length);
 *
 * Copies RAM efficiently, much like memcpy() but with run-time auto-detect of 
 * even aligned source and destination pointers for switch over to word-wise 
 * higher speed copying.
 *
 * Copy performance should be (14 + 1/Byte) instruction cycles for byte mode on
 * dsPIC33E/dsPIC33D/PIC24E devices, including call and return time. For aligned
 * pointers, performance should be (~22 + 0.5/Byte) instruction cycles. Exact 
 * performance may differ if an inline __builtin_memcpy() repeat mov loop is 
 * generated instead.
 * 
 * @param *dest RAM/SFR pointer to write the copied data to. Can be byte
 *              aligned, which will force a byte-wise copy.
 *
 *              This pointer cannot be NULL (0x0000) except when <i>length</i>
 *              is 0.
 *
 *              This pointer may overlap with the *source pointer memory range,
 *              in which case, the copy operation will proceed starting at the
 *              first dest/source byte (or word!) and proceed to the end with
 *              each byte/word being written before the next is read.
 *
 * @param *source SFR/RAM or PSV/Flash pointer to read data from. Can be byte
 *                aligned, which will force a byte-wise copy.
 *
 *                This pointer cannot be NULL (0x0000) except when <i>length</i>
 *                is 0.
 *
 * @param length Number of bytes to copy.
 *    
 *               This value must be <= 16384 on dsPIC30, PIC24F, PIC24H, or
 *               dsPIC33F families (or <= 32768 when dest and source are both
 *               even aligned). 0 is allowed, resulting in no operation.
 *
 *               When the dest and source pointers are both even/word aligned
 *               length still represents a total byte count even though the copy
 *               will proceed using word moves. If length is not a word count
 *               integral, the final element will be moved with a byte 
 *               operation.
 *
 *               If this value is a compile-time constant, the EZBL_RAMCopy() 
 *               call is substituted with a __builtin_memcpy() function call, 
 *               which normally evaluates to a repeat loop with a mov.b 
 *               operation.
 * 
 * @return EZBL_RAMCopy() - void
 *         EZBL_RAMCopyEx() - (void*) pointer, which is *dest incremented by 
 *                            length bytes. The increment is still in bytes, 
 *                            even if a faster word move operation was executed.
