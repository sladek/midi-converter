 * Initializes or re-initializes an EZBL_FIFO structure with zero bytes of data,

 * 
 * @param *fifo pointer to an EZBL_FIFO structure to reset.
 * @param *buffer pointer to a RAM array to store the FIFO's data to.
 * @param bufferLen Number of bytes at the *buffer location to allocate to the 
 *                  FIFO.
 * @param *onWriteCallback() pointer to a callback function to call anytime 0 or 
 *        more bytes of data is written to the FIFO via public APIs 
 *        (EZBL_FIFOWrite(), EZBL_FIFOWrite8(), EZBL_FIFOprintf(), etc.). Set to 
 *        null if unneeded. This function is called after all data has been 
 *        written. Set to null ((void*)0) if you do not need onWrite 
 *        notification.
 * @param *onReadCallback() pointer to a callback function to call anytime 0 or 
 *        more bytes are read or peeked from the FIFO via public APIs. This 
 *        function is called after all data has been read into the callers 
 *        buffer (or discarded for a null read buffer output pointer).
 * 
 *        Set to null ((void*)0) if you do not need onRead/onPeek notification.
 * 
 * @return fifo's dataCount, fifoSize, fifoRAM, headPtr, and tailPtr elements 
 *         are all reset. The activity flags are all cleared, except for 'other'
 *         which is set to '1'.
 * 
 *         Note, the memory contained in the physical buffer memory is not 
 *         zeroed, so any sensitive data that might be contained in them should 
 *         be zeroed externally.
