/**
 * unsigned int EZBL_RAMCompare(void *source1, void *source2, unsigned int length);
 *
 * Compares <i>length</i> bytes from <i>*source1</i> with <i>*source2</i>. On 
 * exact match 0 is returned. If source1 > source2, 1 is returned, otherwise
 * 0xFFFF is returned.
 *
 * @param *source1 RAM or PSV pointer to data to compare against. Address can be 
 *                 byte aligned. This pointer cannot be NULL (0x0000) except 
 *                 when <i>length</i> is 0.
 * @param *source2 RAM or PSV pointer to data to compare. Address can be 
 *                 byte aligned. This pointer cannot be NULL (0x0000) except 
 *                 when <i>length</i> is 0.
 * @param length Number of bytes to compare. Unlike EZBL_RAMCopy() and 
 *               EZBL_RAMSet(), length can be any representable value on any 
 *               device. 0 is allowed, resulting in no operation.
