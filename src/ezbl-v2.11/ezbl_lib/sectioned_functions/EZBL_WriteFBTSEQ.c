/**
 * On a Dual Partition device, writes or rewrites a Partition's FBTSEQ value.
 *
 * This function can target either the Active Partition or the Inactive
 * Partition's FBTSEQ value. If targeting the Active
 * Partition, the FBTSEQ value in Flash must be blank (erase default value of
 * 0xFFFFFF) and be permitted by hardware. When targeting the Inactive
 * Partition's FBTSEQ value, any value can preexist, but success is still
 * dependent on hardware restrictions.
 *
 * The value written can be a relative offset from the currently Active
 * Partition's FBTSEQ value, or any legal 12-bit absolute FBTSEQ value. The
 * proper one's complement value in the upper 12 bits will be automatically
 * computed and programmed, so need not be provided.
 *
 * If the target partition's FBTSEQ value already matches that which is being
 * requested for programming, this function returns immediately.
 *
 * If the target partition is the Inactive Partition and it already has FBTSEQ
 * programmed (to a non-matching value), then the full Flash Page contents will
 * be pushed onto the stack, erased in Flash, and then restored back into the
 * Flash page with the new FBTSEQ value, allowing any value to be programmed at
 * any time the hardware allows it.
 *
 * This function is only available/applicable on devices with Dual Partition
 * hardware and with the Bootloader project compiled for Dual Partition mode.
 *
 * NOTE:
 * The hardware treats illegal FBTSEQ values (one with an unmatching one's
 * complement in the upper 12-bits of the 24-bit FBTSEQ instruction word) as
 * equivalent to 0x000FFF, the lowest possible boot priority. In the event both
 * partitions have illegal FBTSEQ values and/or the value 0x000FFF in them, then
 * Partition 1 will always be chosen for Activation on device reset. Therefore,
 * the first meaningful value that should be programmed with this function, is
 * 0x001FFE.
 *
 * @param target
 *      Flag specifying which partition's FBTSEQ value shall be programmed.
 *      Specify:
 *      <ul>
 *          <li>0 - Write Inactive Partition's FBTSEQ</li>
 *          <li>1 - Write Active Partition's FBTSEQ</li>
 *          <li>-1 - Write Partition 1's FBTSEQ</li>
 *          <li>-2 - Write Partition 2's FBTSEQ</li>
 *      </ul>
 * @param absoluteSEQ
 *      Absolute 12-bit sequence number to write to FBTSEQ. The upper 12-bit
 *      complement is internally computed to always be valid. Specify
 *      relativeSEQ as 0x0000 when using this parameter.
 *
 *      If you wish to program a relative FBTSEQ value, specify 0x0000 for this
 *      parameter.
 *
 * @param relativeSEQ
 *      signed integer added to the NON-targeted partition's FBTSEQ value.
 *      <ul>
 *          <li>Specify 0 when using the absoluteSEQ parameter instead.</li>
 *          <li>Specify -1 to make the target Partition Active at reset</li>
 *          <li>Specify +1 to make the target partition Inactive at reset</li>
 *          <li>Other values are legal, but are unlikely to be useful for
 *              anything.</li>
 *      </ul>
 *
 *      An error code will be returned without programming (or erasing) anything
 *      if the offset would result in underflow below 0xFFF000, the highest
 *      possible priority, the result would overflow above 0x000FFF, the lowest
 *      possible boot priority.
 *
 * @return
 *  <ul>
 *      <li> 1 if the target partition was successfully programmed. Reset
 *             the device or call EZBL_ResetCPU() to have the changes take
 *             effect.</li>
 *      <li>-1 if target partition did not program successfully (blocked by
 *             hardware due to Config segment write protection, or using
 *             Protected Dual Partition mode and targeting Partition 1)</li>
 *      <li>-2 if the target computed relative FBTSEQ value would have
 *             overflowed or underflowed</li>
 *      <li>-3 target parameter value invalid</li>
 *  </ul>
