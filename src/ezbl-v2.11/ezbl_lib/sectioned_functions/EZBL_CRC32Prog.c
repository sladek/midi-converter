/**
 * Computes or continues a CRC-32 (IEEE 802.3 Ethernet version) over Flash data
 *
 * The polynomial implemented is:
 * x32 + x26 + x23 + x22 + x16 + x12 + x11 + x10 + x8 + x7 + x5 + x4 + x2 + x + 1
 * Commonly this is represented as 0xEDB88320 (or 0x04C11DB7 for big endian).
 *
 * This function needs ~120 bytes peak of temporary stack RAM.
 * 
 * @param crcSeed starting value to use in the shift register. Set to 0x00000000
 *                when starting a new CRC32 computation.
 * @param programAddress Program memory address to start reading from. This must
 *                       be aligned to an instruction boundary (i.e. always even
 *                       numbered) on 16-bit PICs/dsPICs.
 * @param byteLength unsigned long count of how many bytes to include in this
 *                   CRC computation starting at the specified address. This
 *                   need not be an integral multiple of the underlying Flash
 *                   storage instruction or word size.
 *
 * @return 32-bit CRC computed
