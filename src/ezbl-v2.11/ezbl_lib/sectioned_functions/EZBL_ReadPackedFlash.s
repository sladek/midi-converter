/**
 * void EZBL_ReadPackedFlash(void *dest, unsigned long baseAddress, unsigned int byteOffset, unsigned int byteCount);
 *
 * Copies Flash/program memory region contents into RAM.
 *
 * Besides ordinary program memory locations, this function can be used to read
 * from Auxiliary Flash, Configuration fuse bytes, and other debug or
 * programming executive memory spaces. On applicable devices programmed for
 * multiple Flash partitions, this function can also be used to read from the
 * inactive Flash partition (starting at address 0x400000), but only when the
 * inactive Flash partition is idle (i.e. not undergoing an erase or programming
 * operation). If the inactive partition is busy with an erase or programming
 * operation, the return results will be indeterminate.
 *
 * Care should be taken to ensure that the target address is legal for the
 * device. Attempting to read from unimplemented memory locations will, in most
 * cases, result in an Address Error Trap rather than returning 0x000000 data.
 * Similarly, on devices that implement segmented Flash Code Protection
 * security, attempting to read from a Flash region that is dissallowed will
 * trigger a device reset.
 *
 * This function must temporary change the TBLPAG register contents in order to
 * issue the read. Ensure no interrupts are implemented which require TBLPAG to
 * be always valid. Alternatively, disable interrupts before calling this
 * function. The TBLPAG contents are restored upon return.
 *
 * @param *dest RAM pointer to write the read program memory data to. This
 *              pointer has no alignment requirements (i.e. can be odd). This
 *              parameter can be null only if byteCount is zero.
 *
 * @param baseAddress Unsigned 32-bit (24-bit) program memory address partially
 *                    specifying where to read from. This address must be even
 *                    (instruction aligned address). The byteOffset parameter is
 *                    added to this address (with proper 3 byte/2 address
 *                    translation) to generate the actual starting read
 *                    location.
 *
 * @param byteOffset A count of how many bytes to add to baseAddress before
 *                   beginning reading. Proper 3-byte/2-address conversion is
 *                   done. For example, if you want to read bits 8-23 of an
 *                   instruction word at address 0x001234 (throwing the first
 *                   8-bits of instruction word data away), you could specify
 *                   baseAddress = 0x001234 and byteOffset = 1.
 *                   Alternatively, baseAddress = 0x001230 and byteOffset = 7
 *                   would address the same byte (byteOffsets 0, 1, and 2 would
 *                   be the 24-bit data bits from address 0x001230; offsets 3,
 *                   4, and 5 would be data from 0x001232, and offset 6 would be
 *                   the least significant 8-bits of the data at address
 *                   0x001234.
 *
 * @param byteCount  Count of many bytes to read from Flash starting at the
 *                   specified address and byte offset. The *dest RAM must have
 *                   this much freespace allocated.
 *
 * @return  Program memory data read is written to the *dest pointer. The data
 *          is returned in naturally packed form (i.e. no "phantom" 0x00 bytes
 *          included).
