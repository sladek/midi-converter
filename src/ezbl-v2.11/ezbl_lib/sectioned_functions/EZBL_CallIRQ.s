/**
 * Calls an Interrupt Service Routine at the same IPL as currently set. The ISR
 * function address is obtained by looking up the IRQ number in the IVT (or
 * AIVT if applicable and enabled), so the function called may not be valid or
 * be directed to a generic _DefaultInterrupt() function if unimplemented.
 *
 * This function sets up a fake ISR call frame on the stack such that when the
 * called ISR executes the RETFIE instruction, execution will return to the
 * instruction after the call instruction that called EZBL_CallIRQ() and retain
 * the same IPL as you called EZBL_CallIRQ() at.
 *
 * This function can be used to call ISRs of lower or higher priority than the
 * current CPU IPL. However, be very careful when doing this as the called ISR
 * can become self-reentrant if the ISR is enabled. Higher priority ISRs will
 * become self-reentrant if the hardware interrupt flag becomes set. Lower
 * priority ISRs will become self-reentrant if the ISR was already active when
 * this call to EZBL_CallIRQ() is made.
 *
 * @param interruptIRQ IRQ number of the ISR function to call. IRQ numbers
 *                     correspond to the bit position for the interrupt flag in
 *                     IFSx registers, or interrupt enable bits in IECx
 *                     registers.
 *
 *                     For example, on a dsPIC33EPXXGS50X family device, the
 *                     data sheet Interrupt Controller chapter shows IRQ 0 as
 *                     being the INT0 interrupt. It has IFS0<0>/IEC0<0> bits
 *                     dedicated to it. INT4 has IRQ 54 and is in
 *                     IFS3<6>/IEC3<6>: 3*16 + 6 = 54. '3' is the register
 *                     number, 16 is the bit width of a IFS/IEC register, and 6
 *                     is the bit position within the register.
 *
 *                     To call a trap, specify a negative IRQ number,
 *                     corresponding to the IVT ordering. Ex:
 *                     <ul>
 *                          <li>-1 = Reserved Trap (7)</li>
 *                          <li>-2 = Generic Soft Trap (6)</li>
 *                          <li>-3 = Reserved Trap (5)</li>
 *                          <li>-4 = Math Error Trap (4)</li>
 *                          <li>-5 = Stack Error Trap (3)</li>
 *                          <li>-6 = Generic Hard Trap (2)</li>
 *                          <li>-7 = Address Error Trap (1)</li>
 *                          <li>-8 = Oscillator Fail Trap (0)</li>
 *                     </ul>
