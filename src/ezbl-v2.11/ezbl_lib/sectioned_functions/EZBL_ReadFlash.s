/**
 * Reads one instruction word (24 bits) from Flash at the specified Flash
 * program memory address. The returned uppermost 8 bits are always 0x00.
 *
 * Besides ordinary program memory locations, this function can be used to read
 * from Auxiliary Flash, Configuration fuse bytes, and other debug or
 * programming executive memory spaces. On applicable devices programmed for
 * multiple Flash partitions, this function can also be used to read from the
 * inactive Flash partition (starting at address 0x400000), but only when the
 * inactive Flash partition is idle (i.e. not undergoing an erase or programming
 * operation). If the inactive partition is busy with an erase or programming
 * operation, the return results will be indeterminate.
 *
 * Care should be taken to ensure that the target address is legal for the
 * device. Attempting to read from unimplemented memory locations will, in most
 * cases, result in an Address Error Trap rather than returning 0x000000 data.
 * Similarly, on devices that implement segmented Flash Code Protection
 * security, attempting to read from a Flash region that is dissallowed will
 * trigger a device reset.
 *
 * This function must temporarily change the TBLPAG register contents in order 
 * to issue the read. The TBLPAG contents are restored upon return.
 *
 * @param address   unsigned 32-bit long integer of the address to read from
 *                  (will actually be 24-bits max and the LSbit must be set to
 *                  0). The EZBL_SYM32() macro can be used if you wish to
 *                  discover the address of a link time symbol.
 *
 * @return  unsigned 32-bit long integer data read from the given program memory
 *          address. Since program data is always 24-bits wide, the upper 8 bits
 *          will always be 0x00.
