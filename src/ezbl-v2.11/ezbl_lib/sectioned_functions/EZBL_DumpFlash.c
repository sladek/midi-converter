  Easy Bootloader Library for PIC24/dsPIC33/PIC32MM

  File Name:
    EZBL_DumpFlash.c

  Summary:
    Implements the EZBL_DumpFlash() API, useful for displaying bulk
    flash/program space contents on a UART or other stdout destination -
    typically for debugging purposes.

/**
 * Prints a given flash/program space range in human readable hexadecimal words
 * to stdout.
 *
 * Use the UART_Reset() or I2C_Reset() macros to initialize the _write handler
 * for stdout. Also, for UARTs, ensure the TX I/O pin has a PPS assignment for
 * it, assuming it needs one. Ex:
 *         // Output on U2TX pin assigned to RP45 at 460800 baud, 8N1, with a
 *         // system clock of 70MIPS, and set this UART interface as the stdio
 *         // target.
 *         _RP45R = _RPOUT_U1TX;
 *         UART_Reset(2, 70000000, 460800, 1);
 *
 * @param startAddr Starting memory address to begin reading and printing. This
 *                  value should be even since program memory addresses always
 *                  increment by 0x2 addresses.
 * 
 *                  Must be a legal memory address for the device (address
 *                  beyond the end of flash up to 0x7FFFFF will typically cause
 *                  an Address Error Trap).
 *
 * @param endAddr   End memory address to stop printing when reached. This
 *                  address is NOT printed (i.e. set this to one location after
 *                  the memory of interest).
