/*******************************************************************************
  Easy Bootloader for PIC24/dsPIC and PIC32MM (ezbl_lib)

  Summary:
    Implements the EZBL_FindFirstErasedPage() ezbl_lib API

  Description:
    Sequentially searches Flash addresses starting at the specified address and
    looks for a Flash page that contains no data (is all '1's).

/**
 * Finds the first Flash page containing all 0xFFFFFF contents (i.e. is 
 * completely erased).
 * 
 * @param startAddress Program Flash address to start searching from. The page 
 *                     that contains this address is tested first.
 * @param searchDirection 
 *                     > 1 Searching will ascend to bigger addresses and 
 *                     stop at the maximum legal Flash address applicable on the 
 *                     device or Flash partition (for devices in a Dual 
 *                     Partition mode or with Auxiliary Flash) that the 
 *                     startAddress resides on.

 *                     
 *                     <= -1 Searching will descend to lower addresses until 
 *                     address 0x000000 is reached or the first legal address of 
 *                     the startAddress's physical partition.
 *
 * @return             Address of the first address of the first Flash Page 
 *                     encountered that is entirely blank. If no erased Flash 
 *                     pages are found, 0xFFFFFFFF is returned.
