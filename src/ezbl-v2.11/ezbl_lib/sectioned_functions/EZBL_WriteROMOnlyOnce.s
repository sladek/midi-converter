/**
 * Identical to EZBL_WriteROM()/EZBL_WriteROMEx() except that the target flash
 * range is read first and any already programmed flash words are individually
 * masked to all '1's in the input data to suppress their write effect.
 * 
 * Set <b>EZBL_NVMKey = 0x03DF</b> before calling this function. Any other value
 * will suppress the Flash write.
 * 
 * If the flash already contains the correct data in the specified addresses, or
 * if it is not possible to write the correct data (i.e. requires clearing a 
 * preexisting '0' back to '1'), then the Flash write for the given word (24 or 
 * 48-bits, depending on device) is skipped. srcData must be in RAM and must be 
 * writable. The data can change (changes to 0xFFFFFF or 0xFFFFFFFFFFFF anywhere 
 * a Flash word cannot or does not need to be programmed).
 *
 * @param flags
 *   Bitwise OR'd collection of flags to modify the writing behavior. Available
 *   options are:
 *      EZBL_FLAG_CLRWDT (0x0400)           - Clear watchdog before each write
 *      EZBL_FLAG_LATE_INT_EN (0x0800)      - Restore interrupts only after NVMOP completes. By default interrupts are disabled only for the unlock sequence that sets NVMCON<WR>.
 *      EZBL_FLAG_IPARTITION (0x1000)       - Force 0x400000-0x7FFFFF Inactive Partition address range (set bit 22 of destProgAddr)
 *      EZBL_FLAG_FIXED_PARTITION (0x2000)  - Use fixed Partition 1/Partition 2 target address range for destProgAddr instead of Active/Inactive relative addresses (XOR bit 22 of destProgAddr with !NVMCON<10>, which is !P2ACTIV on Dual Partition capable devices)
