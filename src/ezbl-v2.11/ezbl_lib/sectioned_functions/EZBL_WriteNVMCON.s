/**
 * Wait for NVMCON<WR> to be clear, disables all interrupts, computes the proper 
 * NVMKEY, copies the computed values into NVMKEY, sets the NVMCON<WR> bit,
 * restores interrupts (if blockUntilDone == 0), polls for completion of the 
 * erase/write operation (if blockUntilDone is non-zero), and then restores 
 * interrupts (if not done already). For the unlock sequence to work correctly, 
 * set:
 *     unlockKeyMultiplier = 0x03E5
 * and:
 *     EZBL_NVMKey = 0x03DF
 *
 * @param nvmconValue Value to write to NVMCON with bit 15 (NVMCON<WR> NOT yet 
 *                    set). This function will issue a second write to set 
 *                    NVMCON<WR> internally after performing correct key 
 *                    sequencing. Bit 14, corresponding to NVMCON<WREN> should 
 *                    be set if you intend to start an erase/write sequence.
 * @param unlockKeyMultiplier Set to value 0x03E5. All other values will result 
 *                            in NVMCON<WR> not getting set and therefore 
 *                            trigger no erase/write operation.
 * @param blockUntilDone <p>Flag indicating if this function should not return
 *                       until the NVMCON write is done and NVMCON<WR> self 
 *                       clears by hardware. Should be 0x0001 (or any value with 
 *                       bit 0 set) to force blocking on certain devices which 
 *                       have an errata on the CPU not stalling correctly (ex: 
 *                       dsPIC33EPXXX(GP/MC/MU)806/810/814 and 
 *                       PIC24EPXXX(GP/GU)806/810/814 rev B1 devices). 0x0000 
 *                       indicates the erase/write should be started and then
 *                       return asynchronously without waiting for hardware to
 *                       clear it.</p>
 *                       
 *                       <p>NOTE: this flag is only a software polling control 
 *                       mechanism. If the underlying NVM hardware requires the 
 *                       CPU to stall for the duration of the erase/write, then
 *                       this parameter will have no effect and the CPU will 
 *                       block regardless.
 *
 * @return NVM erase/write is started (and optionally completed), interrupts are 
 *         restored as appropraite, and EZBL_NVMKey is cleared to zero. If the 
 *         CPU hardware stalls, <i>blockUntilDone</i> is set to '1', or the 
 *         erase/write otherwise completes before the return code is reached, 
 *         then the Write Enable bit, NVMCON<WREN>, is cleared before return.
