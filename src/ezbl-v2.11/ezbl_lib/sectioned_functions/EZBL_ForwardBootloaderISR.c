/**
 * RAM bitfield controlling/indicating which interrupts that the Bootloader
 * implements should be passed to the Application's interrupt handler or 
 * processed by the Bootloader's interrupt handler.
 *
 * This is a 32-bit global variable where each bit represents one IRQ/Vector
 * each, but pruned to only contain bits for interrupts actually implemented in
 * the Bootloader project. Both Application and Bootloader projects can read and
 * write bits within this variable at run time. At Bootloader reset, the CRT
 * will zero all bits in this "virtual RAM register", and at Application launch,
 * the contents defined by the Bootloader will stay unchanged (i.e. the
 * Application's CRT execution will not reset the contents of this virtual
 * register).
 *
 * - A '1' bit indicates the interrupt should be passed untouched and with
 *   minimal delay to the Application project. The Bootloader's ISR for the same
 *   interrupt will be ignored.
 * - A '0' bit indicates the interrupt would be handled by the Bootloader
 *   project's ISR and the Application project will never see the interrupt.
 * - All unused bits are don't care values.
 * - Being defined as an unsigned long, only 32-total Bootloader ISRs can be
 *   controlled with this global variable. If more than 32 ISRs are defined in
 *   your Bootloader project, linking of the Bootloader project will trigger a
 *   build-time error (and you should reconsider having so much code in your
 *   Bootloader project).
 * - The Application project always has dedicated access to all hardware
 *   interrupts that are not run-time selected through this virtual register, so
 *   implementing interrupt handlers in your Bootloader will never preclude
 *   future use of the same hardware in Application projects.
 *
 * As the bit positions and their meanings depend on the ISRs implemented in
 * your Bootloader project, the mapping of bitfields to named interrupts is only
 * pseudo constant. Therefore this variable should not be written to directly.
 * Instead, use the EZBL_ForwardIntToApp(), EZBL_ForwardIntToBoot(),
 * EZBL_ForwardAllIntToApp() and EZBL_ForwardAllIntToBoot() macros to manipulate
 * this pseudo register. However, it is possible to save and restore the whole
 * value as an atomic unit.
 *
 * The parameter required by the EZBL_ForwardIntTo[App/Boot]() macros is the
 * XC16 ISR name of the interrupt, but without a leading underscore and without
 * the 'Interrupt' suffix on it. Ex: an _U2RXInterrupt() ISR is referenced in
 * these macros by the name "U2RX", without quotation marks.
 *
 * To forward the U2RX Interrupt to the Application, you may write
 * your "begin forwarding" code as:
 *      <code>
 *      #include "ezbl_integration/ezbl.h"
 *      ...
 *      EZBL_ForwardIntToApp(U2RX);
 *      </code>
 *
 * To terminate forwarding and let the Bootloader handle the U2RX interrupt,
 * you would atomically clear the same bit without affecting the others:
 *      <code>
 *      EZBL_ForwardIntToBoot(U2RX);
 *      </code>
 *
 * Changes to the bits in this virtual register have immediate effect, assuming
 * global interrupts and the corresponding interrupt enable flag in the IECx
 * registers is set.
