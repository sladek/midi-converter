/*******************************************************************************
  Easy Bootloader Library (ezbl_lib) multipurpose FIFO Source API

  Summary:
    Implements a Flash Read back to .blob file formatting routine, writing the 
    output data to an EZBL_FIFO. 
 
    NOTE: this file format was only used with EZBL v1.xx Bootloaders. The
          EZBL_Flash2Blob() API is therefore deprecated and may be removed in a
          future EZBL version.
