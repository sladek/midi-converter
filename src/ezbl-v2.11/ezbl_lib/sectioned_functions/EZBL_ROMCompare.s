/**
 * Byte-wise compares Flash/program memory to a data array, returning the first
 * difference encountered. This function is similar to the memcmp() C stdlib
 * function (and EZBL_RAMCompare()), but takes a 23-bit Program memory
 * address/symbol value as one of the input arguments instead of two RAM
 * pointers.
 *
 * @param pgmAddress
 *      Unsigned long program memory address for the first array to read from.
 *      This must be an even aligned value. The value 0x000000 means program
 *      Flash address 0x000000 and is not a null value. Data is read from Flash
 *      in packed form (3-bytes per 0x2 addresses and not a dummy zero in every
 *      4th byte location).
 *
 *      No address checking is done to confirm validity of the program address.
 *      Attempting to read from an unimplemented Flash address will normally
 *      result in a Address Error Trap.
 *
 * @param *cmpData Pointer to a byte array, located in RAM or data space
 *                 (including PSV/EDS) to compare against.
 *
 * @param length Maximum number of bytes to compare before returning.
 *
 * @param flags A bitwise OR of the following flag constants:
 *    <ul>
 *      <li>EZBL_FLAG_EQUALS (0x0000): Compare for exact binary equality. All
 *                  bits must match.
 *                  <br>Logically, this tests cmpData - pgmData == 0.</li>
 *      <li>EZBL_FLAG_ZEROS (0x0001): Compare cleared bits only. All '0' bits in
                    *cmpData must have a '0' bit in the corresponding program
 *                  space cell, whereas all '1' bits in *cmpData are don't care
 *                  bits in Flash and can read back as either '1' or '0' and
 *                  still be a match.
 *                  <br>Logically, this tests, (~cmpData) & pgmData == 0.</li>
 *      <li>EZBL_FLAG_ONES (0x0002): Compare set bits only. All '1' bits in
                    *cmpData must have a '1' bit in the corresponding program
 *                  space cell, whereas all '0' bits in the cmpData array are
 *                  don't care values in the Flash.
 *                  <br>Logically, this tests, (~cmpData) | pgmData == 0.</li>
 *      <li>EZBL_FLAG_16BIT (0x0004): Check only lower 16-bits of each
 *                  instruction word. Bits 16-23 of each program word are don't
 *                  care values on read-back, but there must still be dummy
 *                  equivalent cmdData locations for them. The lower 16-bits are
 *                  tested according to the binary EQUALS/ZEROS/ONES matching
 *                  flags.</li>
 *      <li>EZBL_FLAG_8BIT (0x0008): Check only lower 8-bits of each instruction
 *                  word. Bits 8-23 of each program word are don't care values
 *                  on read-back, but there must still be dummy equivalent
 *                  cmpData locations for them. The lower 8-bits are tested
 *                  according to the binary EQUALS/ZEROS/ONES matching flags.</li>
 *      <li>EZBL_FLAG_IPARTITION (0x1000): Force 0x400000-0x7FFFFF Inactive
 *                  Partition address range (set bit 22 of pgmAddress). The
 *                  next/mismatch return addresses will also reflect the
 *                  inactive partition range.</li>
 *      <li>EZBL_FLAG_FIXED_PARTITION (0x2000): Use fixed Partition 1/Partition
 *                  2 address range for pgmAddress instead of Active/Inactive
 *                  relative addresses (XOR bit 22 of pgmAddress with
 *                  !NVMCON<10>, which is !P2ACTIV on Dual Partition capable
 *                  devices).
 *
 *                  The mismatch status program address will reflect the decoded
 *                  address range that was actually compared against.</li>
 *    </ul>
 *
 * @param *mismatchStatus
 *              Pointer to a caller allocated EZBL_MISMATCH_STATUS structure to
 *              receive extended comparison mismatch status data. Set to null if
 *              unneeded.
 *
 *              Values returned should be ignored if EZBL_ROMCompareEx() returns
 *              0, indicating a match.
 *
 * @return 0x0000 if both arrays have matching contents. A non-zero value is
 *         returned if a mismatch is detected.
 *
 *         If <i>length</i> is zero, a 0x0000 matching return value is always
 *         returned without reading from either memory. Unless null,
 *         *mismatchStatus may still be written to with dummy data.
