/**
 * Erases all non-bootloader Flash pages. The function generally blocks until
 * completion. Pages that are already erased are skipped. Configuration Fuse
 * words in Flash memory are also erased if the bootloader has not reserved the
 * entire last page. However, Config Word values defined in the bootloader are
 * automatically restored. Config Bytes on devices with "Non-volatile" Config
 * Words/Bytes are not erased as they do not have an explicit erased state (i.e.
 * they don't need to be erased in order to reprogram them).
 *
 * @remarks EZBL_NVMKey
 *      The EZBL_NVMKey global variable must be set to a value of
 *      <b>0xFC21</b> before calling this function or the erase will be aborted.
 *      Upon success or abort return, EZBL_NVMKey will be cleared to 0x0000.
 *
 * @param clearWatchdog
 *      Flag specifying if the watchdog timer should be cleared before
 *      each page erase. A non-zero value will trigger a ClrWdt() call before
 *      each internal page erase operation.
