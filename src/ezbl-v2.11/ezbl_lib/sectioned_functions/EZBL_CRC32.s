/**
 * Computes or continues a CRC-32 (IEEE 802.3 Ethernet version) over RAM data
 *
 * The polynomial implemented is:
 * x32 + x26 + x23 + x22 + x16 + x12 + x11 + x10 + x8 + x7 + x5 + x4 + x2 + x + 1
 * Commonly this is represented as 0xEDB88320 (when right shifting) or 
 * 0x04C11DB7 (left shifting).
 *
 * @param crcSeed Starting value to use in the shift register. Set to 0x00000000
 *                when starting a new CRC32 computation.
 * @param data Pointer to RAM memory to start reading from. There are no
 *             alignment restrictions.
 * @param byteLength Count of how many bytes to include in this CRC computation
 *                   starting at the specified pointer address.
 *
 * @return 32-bit CRC computed
