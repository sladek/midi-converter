/**
 * Clear the Interrupt Enable bit (ex: IFSx<T1IE> or IFSx<CCT1IE>) used by the
 * NOW timing module and scheduler.
 *
 * If you leave the interrupt disabled for too long and do not poll NOW_32() or
 * NOW_64() frequently enough, it is possible for the 16-bit hardware timer to
 * have rolled over more than once. In this case, you will have lost time,
 * effectively making various stored NOW_16()/NOW_32()/NOW_64() return values
 * less accurate and potentially non-monotonic. It is therefore recommended that
 * the NOW interrupt be disabled or masked for less than 128K instruction
 * cycles max.
 *
 * @return 0 if the prior state of the interrupt was disabled
 *         1 if the prior state of the interrupt was enabled
 *
 *         Timer/CCP Timer interrupt enable bit in IECx register is set to '0'.
 *
 *         If the NOW_Reset() macro or a NOW_TMRx_ResetCalc(),
 *         NOW_TMRx_ResetConst(), NOW_CCPx_ResetCalc(), or NOW_CCPx_ResetConst()
 *         function is never called anywhere in the project (or EZBL bootloader
 *         project), this function will effectively resolve to a series of
 *         no-operations without causing a linking error. I.e. No SFR writes
 *         will take place and no harm will be done, with a mere 0 always being
 *         returned.
