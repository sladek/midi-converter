/**
 * Compares an array of RAM/data space bytes to Flash/program space memory and
 * adjusts return results for Bootloading specific problems that make the Flash
 * behave as a non-ideal read/write memory, such as reserved zeros in Flash
 * Config bytes, unimplemented bits in non-volatile Config bytes, and don't-care
 * mismatches between compiler generated .hex data and MPLAB ICSP programming
 * tools (ex: Config bit masking).
 *
 * See EZBL_ROMCompare()/EZBL_ROMCompareEx() if you wish to do binary
 * comparisons without any equivalence adjustment. This is a wrapper function
 * that internally calls EZBL_ROMCompareEx().
 *
 * @param pgmAddress Even program space address to start verification at.
 *
 * @param *compareData Pointer to RAM/data space (including PSV/EDS) byte array
 *        containing the data that was attempted to be written to Flash. The
 *        data must be packed in byte form without phantom padding. I.e.
 *        byte 0 = pgmAddress low 8-bits,
 *        byte 1 = pgmAddress middle 8-bits,
 *        byte 2 = pgmAddress upper 8-bits,
 *        byte 3 = next pgmAddress low 8-bits, etc.
 *
 * @param length Maximum number of bytes to compare. A non-multiple of 3 is
 *               allowed.
 * @param status [out] Optional pointer to a EZBL_MISMATCH_STATUS structure to
 *        receive extended failure data in the event of a mismatch.
 *
 * @return 0x0000 on successful match, which may or may not have required
 *         adjustment.
 *
 *         Negative return codes for uncorrectable verification mismatches.
 *         -1: General failure with no exception allowed. Mismatch may be due to:
 *             - Attempting to overwrite a Bootloader reserved address that
 *               EZBL_WriteROM[Ex]() blocked.
 *             - Incorrect value in EZBL_NVMKey. See EZBL_WriteROM() API requirements.
 *             - Hardware write protect/Code protect settings
 *             - RAM corruption from an asynchronous ISR that isn't saving state or
 *               is causing incorrect concurrent execution of EZBL functions that
 *               require the same hardware.
 *             - Improper/unimplemented address
 *             - Bad voltage or other electricals/environmentals?
 *
 *         Positive return codes for verification mismatches of lessor
 *         significance, such as an expected failed attempt to overwrite a
 *         Bootloader reserved location.
