/**
 * Returns the current state of the Interrupt Enable bit (ex: IFSy<TxIE> or
 * IFSy<CCTxIE>) used by the NOW timing module and scheduler.
 *
 * @return 0 if the interrupt is disabled
 *         1 if the interrupt is enabled
 *
 *         If the NOW_Reset() macro or a NOW_TMRx_ResetCalc(),
 *         NOW_TMRx_ResetConst(), NOW_CCPx_ResetCalc(), or NOW_CCPx_ResetConst()
 *         function is never called anywhere in the project (or EZBL bootloader
 *         project), this function will effectively resolve to a series of
 *         no-operations without causing a linking error. I.e. No SFR writes
 *         will take place and no harm will be done, with a mere 0 always being
 *         returned.
