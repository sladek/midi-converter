/*******************************************************************************
  Easy Bootloader Library for PIC24/dsPIC33/PIC32MM

  File Name:
    EZBL_DumpRAM.c

  Summary:
    Implements the EZBL_DumpRAM() API, useful for displaying bulk RAM/SFR
    contents on a UART or other stdout destination - typically for debugging
    purposes.

/**
 * Prints a given RAM/SFR data range in human readable hexadecimal words to
 * stdout.
 *
 * Use the UART_Reset() or I2C_Reset() macros to initialize the _write handler
 * for stdout. Also, for UARTs, ensure the TX I/O pin has a PPS assignment for
 * it, assuming it needs one. Ex:
 *         // Output on U2TX pin assigned to RP45 at 460800 baud, 8N1, with a
 *         // system clock of 70MIPS, and set this UART interface as the stdio
 *         // target.
 *         _RP45R = _RPOUT_U1TX;
 *         UART_Reset(2, 70000000, 460800, 1);
 *
 * @param startPtr Starting memory address pointer to begin reading and
 *                 printing. This value can be odd (high byte in a 16-bit
 *                 word).
 *
 *                 Pointers to 0x8000 and above will point to PSVPAG/DSRPAG
 *                 space (typically a 32KB chunk of flash contents instead of
 *                 RAM).
 *
 * @param byteLen   Number of bytes at startPtr to print
