/*******************************************************************************
  Easy Bootloader Library for PIC32MM Library API Source File

  Summary:
    Implements the EZBL_TrapHandler() API on PIC32MM devices. This replaces
    _general_exception_handler() with a great deal of system state information
    printed in human readable form to stdout or EZBL_STDOUT.

/**
 * EZBL general exception/trap handler for PIC32MM devices which will collect
 * all CPU + CP0 registers at the point of the exception and dump them, along
 * with various other RAM, Flash and SFR state information in human readable
 * text form to stdout/EZBL_STDOUT.
 *
 * This function forces inclusion of the EZBL_general_exception_context()
 * function, not the default _general_exception_context function provided by the
 * XC32 toolchain.
 * 
 * To use this trap handler, place this statement in a C source file at
 * file-scope:
 *      EZBL_KeepSYM(EZBL_TrapHandler);
 * EZBL_general_exception(), if present, will be called after executing this
 * trap handler. After EZBL_general_exception() returns, assuming it exists,
 * _general_exception_handler(), will be called, if present. If
 * EZBL_general_exception() does not exist, _general_exception_handler() will be
 * called, if present after returning from this EZBL_TrapHandler() function.
 *
 * @param cause Coprocessor 0 Cause register, in an easily evaluated bitfield
 *              structure. Access cause.val to retrieve the undecoded value
 *              normally available in a _general_exception_handler().
 *
 * @param status Coprocessor 0 Status register, in an easily evaluated bitfield
 *              structure. Access status.val to retrieve the undecoded value
 *              normally available in a _general_exception_handler().
 *
 * @param *cpuRegs Pointer to an EZBL_CPU_REGS structure allocated temporarily
 *                 on the stack that contains all of the MIPS CPU register
 *                 contents when the exception occurred. When this function
 *                 returns, the contents of this structure is deallocated and
 *                 non-saved/temporary register values (t0-t9, v0-v1, a0-a3, a0,
 *                 k0-k1)will be written back into the CPU registers.
 *
 * @param *cp0Regs Pointer to an EZBL_CP0_REGS structure allocated temporarily
 *                 on the stack that contains all of the Coprocessor 0 register
 *                 contents when the exception occurred. When this function
 *                 returns, the contents of this structure is deallocated and
 *                 any values written into it will also be discarded (i.e. they
 *                 are not written back to CP0 at exception return).
