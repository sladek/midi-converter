/**
 * Reads the state of all buttons and updates the values of the ButtonsLastState
 * ButtonsToggled, ButtonsPushed and ButtonsReleased global bitmask variables.
 * The value returned is a bitmask indicating the present absolute button state
 * where '1' means pushed and '0' means released.
 *
 * For this ezbl_lib function to be used, the ButtonPeak() function must be
 * implemented in the Application to correctly read from the I/O pins and
 * discern pushed/released I/O logic polarity.
 *
 * Each '1' bit in the ButtonsToggled, ButtonsPushed, and ButtonsReleased
 * variables represents an event. For example if ButtonRead() indicates a button
 * that was previously released is now pushed ButtonsToggled and ButtonsPushed
 * will have a '1' stored in the corresponding button bitmask position.
 *
 * A '0' bit will be returned in the bitmask position of all variables 
 * corresponding to a given button if the ButtonRead() API is called while the 
 * user is still holding the button down relative to the last call to 
 * ButtonRead().
 *
 * Upon button release, ButtonsToggled and ButtonsReleased will have a '1'
 * stored in the corresponding button bitmask position.
 *
 * All '1's in the ButtonsPushed and ButtonsReleased fields will revert to '0's
 * when ButtonRead() is called again, making them edge sensitive events rather
 * than level sensitive. 
 * 
 * If you wish to re-obtain the button state without altering the edge events
 * (ex: to test a different bit position), reference the ButtonsLastState
 * variable.  ButtonsLastState is a copy of the last returned value for
 * ButtonRead(), so rather than representing events, indicates the most recent
 * absolute button positions.
 *
 * @return Bitmask representing the buttons that are currently pushed ('1' =
 *         pushed, '0' = released).
 *
 *         Button positions that do not exist are returned as '0' in the
 *         bitmask.
 *
 *         If you only want to read the current button state without altering
 *         the ButtonsLastState tracking + ButtonsToggled, ButtonsPushed and
 *         ButtonsReleased values, then call ButtonPeek() instead of this API.
 *
 *         If ButtonPeek() is not implemented, this function returns 0 and
 *         clears the ButtonsLastState, ButtonsToggled, ButtonsPushed and
 *         ButtonsReleased values.
