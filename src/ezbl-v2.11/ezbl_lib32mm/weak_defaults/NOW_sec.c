/**
 * Number of NOW counts per second of physical time (assuming the NOW_Reset()
 * macro was called to initialize the NOW timer).
 *
 * If run time clock switching occurs externally and you are using the system or
 * peripheral clock for the timing reference to NOW, you must call the
 * NOW_SetTimeIntervals() function to recompute this variable. Any NOW APIs
 * which include clock switching internally do not carry this requirement since
 * they will automatically update NOW_us, NOW_ms and NOW_sec internally.
 *
 * This variable is typically the same value as the device clock frequency, so
 * will results in no rounding or truncation error.
 *
 * Note that this is an unsigned long value. You must up-cast this to an
 * (unsigned long long) if you are running at a high clock frequency and want to
 * compute an interval that would overflow a 32-bit integer. For example, if the
 * device clock is 70.0MHz, NOW_sec would be 70,000,000. If you want to
 * compute something that is two minutes (120 seconds), the correct number of
 * NOW counts would be 8,400,000,000, which can't fit in a 32-bit variable. For
 * this clock speed, any calculation (including intermediate ones) requiring
 * more than 61.356 seconds will be invalid without an initial cast to 64-bits.
 * The NOW_64() API would typically also be needed when working with long
 * intervals.
