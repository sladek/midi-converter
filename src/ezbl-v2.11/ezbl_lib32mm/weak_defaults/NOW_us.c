/**
 * Number of NOW counts per microsecond of physical time (0.000001 seconds,
 * assuming the NOW_Reset() macro is called with a suitably fast timer clock
 * to provide microsecond scale resolution).
 *
 * NOTE: Unlike NOW_sec and NOW_ms, this value is a 16-bit unsigned short. When
 * attempting to measure or time a longer interval with a fast timer base
 * frequency (ex: 937u*NOW_us @ 70 MIPS), ensure that final/intermediate
 * arithmetic is applied using an up-casted (unsigned long) NOW_us value to
 * avoid overflow. Ex: (937ul*NOW_us).
 *
 * 31/32kHz LPRC and 32.768kHz SOSC clocks have a period of over 30us, so DO NOT
 * USE NOW_us with such clocks. The value would always be zero. Use a NOW_ms or
 * NOW_sec fractional value instead.
 *
 * If run time clock switching occurs externally and you are using the system or
 * peripheral clock for the timing reference to NOW, you must call the
 * NOW_SetTimeIntervals() function to recompute this variable. Any NOW APIs
 * which include clock switching internally do not have this requirement as
 * they will automatically update NOW_us, NOW_ms and NOW_sec internally.
 *
 * Note that this variable is an integral number, rounded to result in the least
 * amount of error, either positive or negative. Ex: if the clock
 * frequency is 1.500001MHz, one NOW count would represent 1/1500001Hz or 0.6667
 * microseconds. Therefore, NOW_us, the number of NOW
 * counts/microsecond, would be 1.500001 if precision were infinite. Since
 * rounding instead of truncation occurs, this will result in NOW_us
 * returning 2 instead of 1 (-33.33324% error instead of +33.33338%).
 *
 * Be very cautious using this value if your clock frequency is under 500kHz. In
 * this case, 0 will be returned, which could cause a divide by zero exception
 * when divided or 100% error condition when multiplied.
