/**
 * Number of NOW counts per millisecond of physical time (0.001 seconds,
 * assuming the NOW_Reset() macro was called to initialize the NOW timer).
 *
 * If run time clock switching occurs externally and you are using the system or
 * peripheral clock for the timing reference to NOW, you must call the
 * NOW_SetTimeIntervals() function to recompute this variable. Any NOW APIs
 * which include clock switching internally do not carry this requirement since
 * they will automatically update NOW_us, NOW_ms, and NOW_sec for you.
 *
 * Note that this variable is an integral number, rounded to result in the least
 * amount of error, either positive or negative. Ex: if the clock
 * frequency is 32.768kHz, one NOW count would represent 1/32768Hz or
 * 0.030517578125 milliseconds. Therefore, NOW_ms, the number of NOW
 * counts/millisecond, would be 32.768 if precision were infinite. Since
 * rounding instead of truncation occurs, this will result in NOW_ms
 * returning 33 instead of 32 (-0.708% error versus +2.344% error).
