/**
 * Generic write()/read() function for printf()/scanf() and other C stdlib file
 * I/O operations. This function overrides the internal write()/read() function
 * of the library so whenever a higher layer printf() or similar call is made,
 * these functions get called automatically. This allows stdout/stdin to map to
 * these software FIFO functions instead of directly to a UART peripheral.
 *
 * For further information and info on how these functions interact, with C
 * stdlib file read/write IO, see the XC16 C library user's guide (DS50002071),
 * ex:
 * C:\Program Files (x86)\Microchip\xc16\v1.30\docs\MPLAB_XC16_C_Compiler_Users_Guide.pdf
 *
 * @param handle File handle specifying where the write is intended to go (ex:
 *               stdout, stderr, file, etc.) or read comes from (ex: stdin).
 *               handle is not checked here, so this function will wrap ALL
 *               writes to stdout, stderr, and all other file handles. This
 *               function should be modified or replaced if needing other handle
 *               destinations besides this UART module.
 *
 * @param *buffer Pointer to source data being written to the handle, or for
 *                read() pointer to the destination RAM buffer to write the read
 *                data to.
 *
 * @param len Number of bytes that need to be copied from *buffer to the output
 *            handle, or for read(), number of bytes read from the handle.
 *
 * @return int Number of bytes copied from *buffer to the UART TX FIFO (or from
 *         the UART RX FIFO). This function blocks if there is insufficient
 *         space directly in the software TX FIFO until space is freed up.
 *         However, it returns immediately after all bytes have been buffered
 *         allowing efficient asynchronous and pipelined transmission.
