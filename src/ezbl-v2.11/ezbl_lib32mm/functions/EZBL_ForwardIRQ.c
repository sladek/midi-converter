/**
 * Array of Global Pointer accessible RAM pointers to flash (or RAM) Interrupt
 * Service Routines. As common RAM variables shared between Bootloader and
 * Application projects, these pointers cause a jump to an ISR in the Bootloader
 * or an ISR in the Application, depending on their contents at run-time.
 * Use the EZBL_ForwardIRQTo[App/Boot]() or EZBL_ForwardAllIRQTo[App/Boot]()
 * macros to modify these pointers.

/**
 * Dynamically redirects project ownership of the specified hardware interrupt
 * vector between Bootloader and Application projects.
 *
 * @param toAppProject Sets the destination project which should receive the
 *                     specified interrupt. 0 means the Bootloader project will
 *                     receive the interrupt, non-zero means the Application
 *                     project will receive it instead.
 *
 *                     For convenience, the EZBL_ForwardIRQToApp() and
 *                     EZBL_ForwardIRQToBoot() macros may be used to ignore
 *                     instead.

 * @param vectorNumber Interrupt vector number (IRQ #) that you wish to change
 *                     the hardware vectoring destination for. Use the macros
 *                     defined in the <xc.h> to specify this parameter, ex:
 *                     _UART2_RX_VECTOR, _TIMER_1_VECTOR, etc.
 *
 *                     If the Bootloader project does not implement an ISR for
 *                     the specified vector number, this function will do
 *                     nothing (hardware vectoring will branch to whatever
 *                     project is executing/defined by EBase).
 *
 * @return Last ISR function address which was programmed for the vector number.
 *         If no Bootloader ISR was defined for the vector number, 0 is
 *         returned.
 *
 *         If an interrupt is forwarded to the Application and no Application
 *         exists in flash, this function has no current or future effect and
 *         will return 0.
