/**
 * Sets the baud rate associated with a UART TX or RX EZBL_FIFO and/or enables
 * hardware auto-baud. Existing FIFO contents are unchanged.
 *
 * @param *TxRxFifo Pointer to an EZBL_FIFO structure associated with a UART TX
 *                  or UART RX FIFO. Usually, this will be a &UARTx_TxFifo or
 *                  &UARTx_RxFifo reference, or a saved pointer like
 *                  EZBL_STDOUT or EZBL_COM_RX. Typically these are instanced by
 *                  a prior call to the UART_Reset() macro.
 *
 *                  The TxRxFifo->irqNum parameter must be set before calling
 *                  this function so that the correct UxBRG register (and
 *                  optionally UxMODEbits.ABAUD bit) are referenced. This
 *                  parameter is automatically set if the FIFO was previously
 *                  initialized using UART_Reset(), UART_ResetBRG(), or
 *                  UART_ResetCalc().
 *
 *                  This pointer can be null, resulting in no operation.
 *                  However, this pointer must not point to a non-UART FIFO
 *                  type (doing so will result in data corruption of an
 *                  undefined UART's SFRs).
 *
 * @param newBaud   Desired baud rate to set the hardware UART peripheral to.
 *                  Set as a <= 0 value to enable hardware auto-baud.
 *
 *                  A negative newBaud value is defined to mean: enable
 *                  auto-baud, but still compute and assign UxBRG to the
 *                  positive equivalent newBaud value. This typically allows TX
 *                  operations at a fixed, known baud rate until a 0x55 ('U') RX
 *                  character is received to redefine the baud rate.
 *
 *                  The NOW_Fcy global variable is referenced to run-time
 *                  compute the necessary UxBRG value based on the current
 *                  system clock setting. If newBaud == 0, this reference is
 *                  still generated, but the NOW_Fcy value is unused.
 *
 * @return Prior value contained in UxBRG of the UART that was updated. NOTE:
 *         this is returned as a signed integer, so if the hardware implements
 *         UxBRG with 16 or more bits on a 16-bit platform, UxBRG values > 32767
 *         will be returned as a negative value. Any higher order bits would not
 *         be returned.
 *
 *         The following status bits are written by this function:
 *              TxRxFifo->activity.other = 1;
 *              TxRxFifo->activity.framingError = 0;
 *              TxRxFifo->activity.parityError  = 0;
 *
 *         If TxRxFifo is a null pointer or TxRxFifo->irqNum is an illegal IRQ
 *         number (i.e. > 255), -1 is returned.
