/**
 * Computes or continues a CRC-32 (IEEE 802.3 Ethernet version) over a stream of
 * bytes.
 *
 * The polynomial implemented is:
 * x32 + x26 + x23 + x22 + x16 + x12 + x11 + x10 + x8 + x7 + x5 + x4 + x2 + x + 1
 * Commonly this is represented as 0xEDB88320 (or 0x04C11DB7 for big endian).
 *
 * @param crcSeed Starting value to use in the shift register. Set to 0x00000000
 *                when starting a new CRC32 computation.
 * @param data Pointer to memory to start reading from. There are no alignment
 *             restrictions.
 * @param byteLength Count of how many bytes to include in this CRC computation
 *                   starting at the specified pointer address.
 *
 * @return 32-bit CRC computed. Pass this value back in for the crcSeed
 *         parameter when continuing a checksum with more data.
