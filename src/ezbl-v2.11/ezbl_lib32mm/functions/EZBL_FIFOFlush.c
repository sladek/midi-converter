/**
 * Blocks until the FIFO holds 0 bytes, a timeout is reached, or an
 * implementation defined flush callback function returns.
 *
 * When the fifo->flushFunction pointer callback has been configured (set to a
 * non-null value), a timer is started, a TimeIsUp() function pointer is
 * generated, and execution is passed to the callback. If the callback chooses
 * to obey the timeout parameter, it can call the TimeIsUp() function to
 * determine when it should return.
 *
 * Only when fifo->flushFunction is zero, this function internally blocks until
 * the FIFO contents reach zero or the specified NOW timeout is reached.
 *
 * @param *fifo Pointer to the FIFO to "flush". If null, no operation is
 *              performed.
 *
 * @param timeout Maximum length of time the flush operation can block for,
 *                specified in NOW counts.
 *
 *                Use a multiple of NOW_second, NOW_millisecond, and/or
 *                NOW_microsecond to choose this timeout.
 *
 *                The special value (unsigned long)-1, or 0xFFFFFFFF, indicates
 *                an infinite wait time.
 *
 * @return flushFunction()'s callback return value, or, when null:
 *         <ul>
 *              <li>1 - All bytes in the FIFO were flushed (0 bytes remain) or
 *                      fifo was a null pointer</li>
 *              <li>0 - Timeout occurred</li>
 *         </ul>
