/**
 * File:   EZBL_EraseAppSpace.c
 *
 * Iterates over PIC32MM Application space flash pages, blank checks them, and
 * if not blank, starts an NVMCON flash page erase operation. Only one page is
 * erased per call to avoid a long blocking loop.

 * Erases all flash pages dedicated to the Application (address ranges contained
 * in the ".text.EZBLAppSpaceGeometry" section) in a piecewise fashion.
 *
 * Set <b>EZBL_NVMKey = 0xFC21</b> before each call to this function.
 *
 * Since erasing flash pages requires a long execution time, this function
 * returns between each page erase operation, allowing housekeeping and other
 * tasks to be serviced before starting another page erase operation.
 *
 * @param *eraseState pointer to an unsigned int to keep internal track of which
 *                    page was last erased/which page will be erased next.
 *
 *                    On first call, set this memory location to 0x0000. Ignore
 *                    the return value on subsequent calls, but return the same
 *                    value when continuing the erase sequence.
 * @return <ul>
 *              <li>1 - Erase sequence was initiated for a block of memory. One
 *                      or more calls to EZBL_EraseAppSpace() are required to
 *                      complete the erase.</li>
