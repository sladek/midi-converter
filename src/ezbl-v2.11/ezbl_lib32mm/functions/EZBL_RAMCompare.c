/**
 * Easy Bootloader Library for PIC24/dsPIC33/PIC32MM
 *
 * Created 2017 April 05
 *
 * Implements EZBL_RAMCompare() API for testing equality of two arrays in 
 * memory. On PIC32MM platforms, flash memory can also be compared with this 
 * function, despite the name (16-bit backwards compatibility).
