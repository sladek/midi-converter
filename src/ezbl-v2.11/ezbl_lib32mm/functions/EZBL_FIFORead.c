void * EZBL_RAMCopyEx(void *dest, const void *source, unsigned int length);



/**
 * Reads and removes or peeks at data in a circular EZBL_FIFO, outputting to a
 * normal RAM array. The tailPtr is incremented and dataCount atomically
 * reduced for reads.
 *
 * After the data has been read/peeked from the FIFO and copied to *dest, an
 * optional call to the source->onReadCallback() function is made. This call is
 * made only when *onReadCallback is not null.
 *
 * The onRead callback function must have type:
 *      unsigned int yourOnReadFuncName(unsigned int bytesPulled, void *readDest, unsigned int reqReadLen, EZBL_FIFO *srcFIFO);
 * The return value of this callback is returned unchanged by 
 * EZBL_FIFORead()/EZBL_FIFOPeek(), giving you an opportunity to manipulate the
 * read contents, return value, and/or trigger other code to refill any FIFO
 * free space generated by the read. The bytesPulled parameter specifies the
 * byte count removed from the FIFO, *readDest is the original value of *dest,
 * reqReadLen is the original value of dataLen, and *srcFIFO is the pointer to
 * the FIFO that is calling the callback (so one callback handler function could
 * be implemented to handle multiple different FIFOs simultaneously).
 *
 * Note: when implementing the onRead callback, *readDest can be null if *dest
 * was null when EZBL_FIFORead() was called. In such cases, the read data was
 * thrown away and cannot be reobtained. Technically the data is still in the
 * FIFO backing RAM and could be read for real through direct access, but since
 * the source->dataCount and tailPtr values have already been updated by the
 * time the callback is called, the data is subject to being overwritten by any
 * asynchronous events that may write to the FIFO. This ordering exists to allow
 * APIs that write to the FIFO to be called directly in the onReadCallback().
 *
 * @param *dest Pointer to write the output data to. If null, no read is
 *              performed but the tailPtr, dataCount, and return value will
 *              still be set as if a normal read took place, effectively
 *              throwing the buffer data away.
 *
 *              If source->onReadCallback() is non-null, it will still be called
 *              for null *dest values.
 *
 * @param *srcFIFO EZBL_FIFO structure to read data from. Read underflow is
 *                 suppressed.
 *
 *                 If this pointer is null, the function returns immediately
 *                 with 0.
 *
 * @param dataLen Number of bytes to read. This value must be <= 16384 on
 *                dsPIC30, PIC24F, PIC24H, or dsPIC33F families.
 *
 *                Zero length is allowed, resulting in no read operation, but
 *                the source->onReadCallback() callback is still called, if
 *                defined.
 *
 * @return Return value from the source->onReadCallback() function or the number
 *         of bytes read and removed from the FIFO when no callback is defined.
 *         Unless changed by the callback routine, this parameter will be less
 *         than <i>length</i> only if the FIFO has run out of data to read.
