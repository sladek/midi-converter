 * void EZBL_RestoreInterrupts(unsigned int enabledState);
 *
 * Sets the CP0 Status<IE> register to the specified interrupt enable state.
 * This function is named for compatibility with the EZBL_RestoreInterrupts()
 * function used in the 16-bit version of ezbl_lib.a, but is capable of directly
 * enabling/disabling interrupts without internal decoding.
 *
 * @param enabledState Flag indicating if interrupts shall be enabled (1) or
 *                     disabled (0) upon function return.
 *
 * @return Status<IE> set or cleared to match enabledState
