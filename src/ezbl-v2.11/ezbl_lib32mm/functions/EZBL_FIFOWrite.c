/**
 * Writes data into a circular EZBL_FIFO RAM buffer from a normal data array,
 * updating the headPtr and dataCount in the FIFO structure. dataCount is
 * updated atomically without disabling interrupts.
 *
 * After the write is complete and the headPtr/dataCount FIFO parameters
 * updated, an optional destFIFO->onWriteCallback() function pointer is called.
 * This callback is invoked only when the pointer is non-null.
 *
 * The onWrite callback function must have type:
 *      unsigned int yourOnWriteFuncName(unsigned int bytesPushed, void *writeSrc, unsigned int reqWriteLen, EZBL_FIFO *destFIFO);
 * The return value of this callback is returned unchanged by EZBL_FIFOWrite(),
 * giving you an opportunity to manipulate the FIFO contents, return value,
 * and/or trigger other code to start reading the data out of the FIFO (ex: to a
 * UART TX or other communications ISR). The bytesPushed parameter specifies the
 * byte count actually added to the FIFO, *writeSrc is the original value of
 * *source, and reqWriteLen is the original value of dataLen.
 *
 * Note: the onWrite callback is called after the write has already taken place.
 * Therefore, any manipulation done to the writeSrc array will have no effect on
 * the FIFO. However, as writing to the FIFO does not destroy or manipulate the
 * source data, it is possible to re-read the source data from the original
 * pointer if you wish to save the data elsewhere (ex: a second FIFO connected
 * to a debug terminal or other "communications tee").
 *
 * @param *destFIFO EZBL_FIFO pointer to write the copied data to. FIFO overflow
 *                  is supressed. FIFO wraparound and write pointer update is
 *                  internally handled.
 *
 *                  If this pointer is null (0x0000), all processing is skipped
 *                  and no data is read from *source. However, EZBL_FIFOWrite()
 *                  returns dataLen, emulating an infinite bit-bucket.
 * @param *source RAM or PSV pointer to read data from. Address can be byte
 *                aligned. This pointer cannot be null except when <i>length</i>
 *                is 0.
 * @param dataLen Number of bytes to copy. This value must be <= 16384 on
 *                dsPIC30, PIC24F, PIC24H, or dsPIC33F families.
 *
 *                Zero is allowed, resulting in no write operation. However, the
 *                destFIFO->onWriteCallback() function will still be called, if
 *                not null.
 *
 * @return Value returned by destFIFO->onWriteCallback() or the number of bytes
 *         written to the FIFO. When unchanged by the callback, this parameter
 *         will be less than <i>length</i> only when the FIFO becomes completely
 *         full and the write is terminated early to avoid FIFO overflow.
 *
 *         If *destFIFO is null, dataLen is returned, emulating a successful
 *         write.
