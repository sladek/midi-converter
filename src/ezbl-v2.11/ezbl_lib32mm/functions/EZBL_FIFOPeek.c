/**
 * Peeks at the data in a circular EZBL_FIFO, outputting to a normal RAM array.
 * FIFO state and contents are left unchanged, however, the onRead() callback
 * function for the FIFO, if set, is still called.
 *
 * @param *dest Pointer to write the output data to.
 *
 *              Null is allowed, but results in no operation occurring.
 *
 * @param *srcFIFO EZBL_FIFO structure to peek data from. Read underflow is
 *                 suppressed.
 *
 *                 If this pointer is null, the function returns immediately
 *                 with 0.
 *
 * @param dataLen Number of bytes to read.
 *
 *                0 is allowed, resulting in no operation.
 *
 * @return Number of bytes peeked from the FIFO. This parameter will be less
 *         than <i>length</i> only if the peeking pointer has reached the end of
 *         all available data.
