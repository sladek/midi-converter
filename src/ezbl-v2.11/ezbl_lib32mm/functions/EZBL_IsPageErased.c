/**
 * Blank checks a given Flash Page. A page is considered erased if it reads back
 * as all '1's in every location.
 *
 * An exception is made for the last page of Boot Flash containing the device
 * Configuration Words (0xBFC01700). On this page, two reserved bits will
 * normally read back as '0', even when freshly erased. Therefore, when
 * <i>address</i> specifies this same page, a don't care exception is made for
 * these bits.
 *
 * NOTE: If the page contains significantly corrupt Flash data, for example, due
 * to a power failure in the middle of erase or programming, then this function
 * can trigger a general exception trap. This will occur whenever the ECC bits
 * for the target read location indicate an uncorrectable error and will
 * manifest as a Bus Error Exception (load) in CP0 CAUSE&lt;EXECCODE&gt;.
 *
 * @param addressOnPage
 *          Target address to check for erased status. The address can lie
 *          anywhere on the page with the function internally starting at the
 *          first location on the page and terminating on the last location in
 *          the page, or the first non-blank word, whichever is found first.
 *
 *          addressOnPage can be a virtual address or physical address. The
 *          blank check reads will occur against a kseg1 (uncached) pointer.
 *
 * @return <ul><li>0 - Page is NOT blank</li>
 *             <li>1 - Page is blank</li></ul>
