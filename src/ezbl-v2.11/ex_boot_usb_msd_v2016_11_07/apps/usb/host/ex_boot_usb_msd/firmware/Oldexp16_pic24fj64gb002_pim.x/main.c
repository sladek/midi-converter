  Function:
    bool USB_ApplicationEventHandler( uint8_t address, USB_EVENT event,
                void *data, uint32_t size )

  Summary:
    This is the application event handler.  It is called when the stack has
    an event that needs to be handled by the application layer rather than
    by the client driver.

  Description:
    This is the application event handler.  It is called when the stack has
    an event that needs to be handled by the application layer rather than
    by the client driver.  If the application is able to handle the event, it
    returns true.  Otherwise, it returns false.

  Precondition:
    None

  Parameters:
    uint8_t address    - Address of device where event occurred
    USB_EVENT event    - Identifies the event that occurred
    void *data         - Pointer to event-specific data
    uint32_t size      - Size of the event-specific data

  Return Values:
    true    - The event was handled
    false   - The event was not handled

  Remarks:
    The application may also implement an event handling routine if it
    requires knowledge of events.  To do so, it must implement a routine that
    matches this function signature and define the USB_HOST_APP_EVENT_HANDLER
    macro as the name of that function.

/**
 * Checks if a USB Mass Storage Device is attached, and if so, checks to see if 
 * a "FIRMWARE.BL2" application firmware file is present in the root directory.
 * If not found or a 1 second mounting/searching timeout elapses, the existing
 * application in flash is launched (if one exists). If none exists, this
 * function returns and you should call it again in the future to test again for
 * USB MSD insertion with an appropriate "FIRMWARE.BL2" file to install.
 * 
 * If a "FIRMWARE.BL2" file is found on the attached MSD, it is checked to see
 * if it matches the Application firmware already installed in flash. If it
 * matches, the Application is immediately launched without bootloading 
 * anything.
 * 
 * If the "FIRMWARE.BL2" file contains different firmware, then the existing
 * application is erased, "FIRMWARE.BL2" is decoded and programmed to flash,
 * and if all operations succeeded, the newly installed application is 
 * flagged as valid and immediately launched. If the "FIRMWARE.BL2"
 * decoding/programming fails (ex: contains a corrupt or invalid EZBL image, 
 * user unplugs the USB drive during programming, power is lost, drive read 
 * error occurs, etc.), then this function returns with the partially programmed 
 * application left in flash, but not marked as valid. The partial image will
 * not be executed on subsequent reset or calls to EZBL_MSDBootloaderTasks(). A
 * valid and readable "FIRMWARE.BL2" image is needed to repeat the process
 * successfully.
 * 
 * @param resetInternalState
 *        Flag indicating that this function should reset its internal countdown
 *        timer and other internal variables/peripheral state. Set to non-zero
 *        to force this internal state reset. 0 maintains internal state, except
 *        for the first call after reset, where the function will always reset
 *        its internal state, regardless of the resetInternalState parameter
 *        value.
 * 
 * @return This function only returns during the initial 1-second MSD mounting 
 *        window or when no valid application firmware exists to execute 
 *        instead. Otherwise, this function will launch the existing or new 
 *        application and not return.

 *                  By the time this callback is called, the BOOTID_HASH has
 *                  already been confirmed as a match for this Bootloader.
 *                  Additionally, checking of EZBL_NO_APP_DOWNGRADE conformance
 *                  has passed, when enabled and an existing Application is
 *                  already installed.
 *
 * @return Return 0 to reject the offered firmware image or 1 to accept the
 *         image and proceed with erase/programming steps.
 *
 *         This USB Host MSD implementation calls the EZBL_AppPreInstall
 *         function pointer, when non-null, to let an existing Application
 *         decide if it is appropriate to shutdown and let bootloading proceed.
 *         When bootloading due to device reset with storage media inserted, any
 *         existing Application would not have set EZBL_AppPreInstall to a
 *         non-null value.
 *
 *         By default, this USB Host MSD bootloader only executes at device
 *         reset (before any existing App has started executing), so this
 *         callback is not required. EZBL_AppPreInstall will always contain
 *         null.
